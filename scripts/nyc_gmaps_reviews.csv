Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"The burger was great served medium. The fries were delicious too. Perfect serving size. I wish the pickle was thinly sliced to easily add to the burger though.

I love creme brûlée so I was very disappointed when mine came out very poorly. The consistency was all wrong.

Other than that, the atmosphere was great."

Boucherie Union Square,3.0,"I came here 3 years ago by myself and had an amazing dinner, however I recently brought my family and had a completely different experience. The food was just okay, and the service was TERRIBLE. My family and I did not feel welcomed at all during this past experience, our waiter had a horrible attitude and literally threw the menus on the table. He took forever to introduce himself, was not helpful when it came to questions we had, and would literally ignore us when we needed more water or drinks. There are nicer and better restaurants in the city to spend your money at."

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"We stopped for brunch on a nice Sunday morning. The ambience and feel in the restaurant transports you to Europe. Our server, Ben was amazing and helped us with good recommendations. The coffee was amazing. I had the eggs Norwegian which was rich and flavorful but didn’t leave me feeling heavy afterwards. My wife had “le croque madame” which was a very good sandwich as well. Definitely recommend considering this spot for a meal if you’re in the area. On my personal scale, it scores an 8/10."

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"Boucherie was the first restaurant I experienced when visiting NYC in 2015, and from the moment I walked in, I was hooked. Fast forward 10 years… and it’s still that perfect NYC classy vibe. If you know, you know. Adam has been the absolute best barkeep with the most pleasant and welcoming spirit. The music, food, wine… my absolute go-to when visiting the city."

He was animated, had a great sense of humor, knew the menu very well and made great recommendations. The food was also phenomenal! Definitely a must try if you are in gramercy."

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"Boucherie has a great space and a fun vibe and the food lives up to it.  There are three menu items that I want to be excellent at a French Bistro.  The Salade Nicoise, The Burger, and the Fries. (We could add French onion soup and the Croque Madame but I didn’t get to try those yet).  Add the fact that they have a great wine list with thoughtful selections at fair prices.  This is my new “go to” bistro in NY!"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"I had such a lovely experience at Boucherie Union Square! Everything I ordered was beautifully prepared and full of flavor. The Soupe à l’Oignon was warm and comforting, and the La Salade Niçoise had the perfect balance of freshness and richness. The Steak Frites? A must-try, cooked perfectly and paired with crispy pommes frites.

For dessert, the Profiteroles and Tarte aux Fraises totally stole the show, so indulgent and beautifully plated. I also loved the non-alcoholic cocktails, Non La Vie en Rose and Hors Du Bleu, light, refreshing, and so fun.

The only thing I found just okay was the Lobster Linguine; it wasn’t bad, just didn’t stand out like the rest. But overall, the atmosphere, service, and food made it such a memorable dining experience. Can’t wait to come back!"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"Guys!! I think I’ve just found one of my favorite French restaurants in NYC. The food is exceptional, the service is impeccable, and the staff is incredibly warm and attentive. They went above and beyond to make my anniversary dinner truly special, and I couldn’t be more grateful. Every dish was perfection—from the delicate Wagyu carpaccio to the beautifully cooked lamb rack with celery gratin and Gruyère. And don’t even get me started on the sea scallops… absolute heaven ❤️ and until 31 of march bottle of wine is 50% off"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"I went on New Year’s Eve, and I loved the idea of being able to enjoy a delicious meal and toast at midnight without having to pay an extra cover. The food was very tasty, the drinks were well-served, and the place was beautiful. However, I would have liked the ratatouille to have a different presentation. Unfortunately, the bartender who attended us at the end was neither professional nor polite."

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"Atmosphere: Entire restaurant is decorated nicely and I do feel like I could be in Paris.  However, I don’t recall how many restaurants in Paris would have triple height ceilings though.

Service: attentive

Food: overall everything we ordered was good. However my braised coq au vin was very dry.
I highly recommend the steak and French Onion Soup"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"Boucherie Union Square nails it — gorgeous Parisian vibe, lively energy, and service that makes you feel taken care of without hovering. Anais was fantastic. The Waygyu filet melted like butter, the steak tartare portion was perfect, and the cocktails? Absolute perfection. It’s the kind of place you could dress up for or just wander into and still feel welcome."

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"This was my favorite place until all of a sudden they took the salmon out of the menu. It was out of the blue. It was my favorite dish from them. Can we please bring the salmon back? Such a small detail, but with such a powerful power. We pescatarians would appreciate this so much."

Boucherie Union Square,3.0,"Went here around Christmas time for dinner and was fairly disappointed unfortunately.

The good: the restaurant is immaculately decorated for the holidays and atmosphere is lively and fun.

The bad: the steak was tough and overcooked. I was with a large group of 10+ people and not a single person finished their steak. Desserts and appetizers were ok as well."

Boucherie Union Square,3.0,"I recently visited this restaurant with a friend and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the bread with spread butter was delicious, and the lager was really great. The atmosphere and servers were also very nice.

However, I was disappointed with the orange duck I ordered. The meat was tough and chewy, and I couldn't even finish one piece of duck. The restaurant was kind enough to take it back to the kitchen, but I was already too discouraged to order another main course. Instead, we opted for the crème brûlée for dessert, which was absolutely delicious.

Overall, while the service and ambiance were pleasant, my experience with the main course was not great. My friend tried to introduce me to French cuisine, but unfortunately, this particular restaurant did not leave a lasting impression."

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"We had such a wonderful time here this weekend. Erica and her team were helpful, knowledgeable, and provided such attentive service. Having drinks at the bar before we moved over to food, Adam was such a gracious host as our bartender. Our drinks were delicious as was the wine we settled on (thanks again to Erica). The food we selected was timed expertly and executed with perfection — hats off to the chef and their crew. We can’t wait to return and try new delights paired with what we know will be impeccable service. Merci!"

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"Stopped by here on a Saturday as a solo diner to take advantage of happy hour. It was my first time visiting this Boucherie but I highly recommend it as a solo spot. I sat myself at the bar and was made to feel welcome straight away. I decided to order the oysters and the charcuterie board (both from the happy hour menu) along with a glass of sparkling wine. The pacing of the food being delivered was perfect for me, with a good wait between my order and the food arriving but not so long that it felt you had been waiting an age.

I went for a mixture of east and west coast oysters (a small complaint is that these were served so cold that I think some of the flavour was lost). The charcuterie board was a great portion of meat, especially for the price. I also decided to order dessert and got the profiteroles. The pastry and the chocolate sauce were delicious, However, I am used to profiteroles being filled with cream and these just had too much ice cream filling for me so I would probably order something else next time (this is down to personal preference though instead of the dish being bad).

All in all I really enjoyed my time here and will definitely be back. Total bill (including my food, 2 glasses of sparkling wine, tax and tip) was just under $100, which I thought was good value for what I had and the area I was in. They currently have an offer with 50% most bottles of wine so have already suggested to my other half we should visit soon and take advantage of that!"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"If you’re looking for a memorable night out, make sure to visit the bar where Adam is working! He’s an exceptional bartender who not only serves up delicious drinks but also knows how to engage in meaningful conversations.

From the moment we sat down, Adam made us feel welcome with his friendly demeanor. He crafted our cocktails with precision, ensuring each drink was not just tasty but also beautifully presented. What really stood out was his ability to connect with us on a personal level. He shared stories and insights about life that made our experience feel special and memorable.

His passion for mixology and genuine interest in his customers turned an ordinary evening into something extraordinary. We left with happy hearts and plans to return soon. Thanks, Adam, for a fantastic night! We can’t wait to come back for more great drinks and conversations."

Boucherie Union Square,3.0,"The interior was plain and classic. There were many customers because it was the end of the year, and it was full of families and friends. The Rib-Eye Steak had a good texture and taste, but there was a lot of fat. The onion soup was sour and had a lot of burnt flavor. It was not a dish I would recommend. The boiled octopus dish was chewy and went well with the appropriate sauce. The crème brûlée was sweet, so it was a good choice for dessert. The ice cream with vanilla and chocolate syrup was also delicious. However, it was difficult to meet the manager in charge when ordering or requesting additional items. Also, I gave a 15% tip because I was not satisfied with the service, and I felt that the female manager's dissatisfaction was clearly revealed. It seems that customer service, which is not seen even in ordinary restaurants, not the best restaurants, needs improvement. Otherwise, they might have treated customers differently depending on race."

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"We had a very nice time at this boucherie location. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. The only reason I give 4 stars is because we arrived on time for our reservation but still had to wait almost 20 mins before we were seated even though their online system showed a lot of availability. Also, the fries were extremely salty. I normally don’t mind a little extra salt on fries but this was excessive. Other than that, very delicious meal and quality service"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"Great French place, one of the best in NYC! My wife had the steak frites, which was excellent (and she’s Asian American and very picky with steak), and I had their vegetarian cauliflower which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. And the desserts… the profiteroles were excellent, and the chocolate mousse - the only proper soundtrack for it would be Sinead o’Connor’s “Nothing compares to U”. Highly recommend!"

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"This Boucherie location is the best I’ve visited!
It offers a cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and excellent service.

The skirt steak was juicy and packed with flavor, although it was slightly overcooked (I ordered medium rare, but it leaned closer to medium). The side of fries was absolutely perfect—crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

The clams were a standout! The sauce was simply magnificent—rich in flavor yet surprisingly light.

For drinks, I had an oat milk cappuccino, and my friend enjoyed a beer. Both were fantastic and complemented the meal beautifully"

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"We went for dinner before a show on a Friday night. Everything was still decorated for Christmas and it was super festive and classy. Decent cocktail selection and large wine selection. The bread with salt and butter was amazing. The French onion soup was the best I have ever had. We ordered the steak frites for our main course. They were really solid, but I had super high expectations after the bread and soup and I thought it could have been a little better. We didn't get dessert because we were so full but their options looked great. So glad we tried this restaurant!"

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"Stopped by for a quick dinner on a business trip. Lobster bisque for my appetizer and a steak for my main. Seated right away at a center table, server was prompted, professional and courteous.

Food: lobster bisque was quite good. Not too salty as can happen. Very nice pieces of lobster   steak was medium-rare as requested. Nice glass of merlot with the meal

Service: seated right away even without reservations. Server took time to check on me without being intrusive.

Atmosphere: beautiful high ceiling entrance with lovely bar to the left and dinning space to the right. Very enjoyable."

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"Very cozy, beautiful 70s atmosphere. Celebrated my birthday dinner here. The food was very underwhelming, especially the Caesar salad we shared. As for the starter, the salad was so dry, unflavorful, and salty. I love Caesar salad and order it almost every time I have to choose a salad for the table, but this one, I would say, was the worst I had in NYC. The next day, I had another one served at a Spanish restaurant 10 minutes walk from here, which was 10 times fresher and more delicious. My boyfriend had Traditional French Braised beef, and I ordered the grilled pork tenderloin for myself.  The food by far mediocre at best.
Nothing really blew me away though the price tag wasn’t really hefty."

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,This restaurant is in the top 3 restaurants I’ve ever been to! Our steaks were perfectly cooked and the service and atmosphere is remarkable. We got oysters and the watermelon salad for starters and everything was fresh and the sauces for the oysters were delicious especially the malt vinegar based sauce. I recommend the steak frites! For drinks get an espresso martini.

Boucherie Union Square,4.0,"What a lovely place to be for the holidays given their decorations they put up. Their long bar is also such a great place to hang out and have a cocktail or two. Went here for date night and got a few dishes: the steak, wagyu burger, fish dip with caviar and the beets. The beets and burger were not my favorite, but the steak was quite good.

Definitely would come back here during the summer time for cocktails."

Boucherie Union Square,1.0,"Horrible experience. Just went there for dinner tonight. Reception was nice but the server and whole experience with ordering wine and food was a mess. I know the restaurant is having 50% for wine, but at least prepare your inventory. Tried with two bottom from the wine list, first one server came back told us it sold out. Second one took him almost 15min to get back to us to confirm they are out for that as well. We double checked with server that they have it before we chose the second bottom. That’s almost 20-25min after we sat down, with no one takes the food order. I would call that a promotion trap when you run into these “coincidence”. Or it might just because we are Asian 😐.
The crazier part is the server didn’t remove the charge for the wine(full price with no 50%off) and gave us the check. We had to talk to the server to get it removed so we don’t have to pay for something we never got.🤷🏻‍♀️ Not a first timer here but probably not coming back again."

Boucherie Union Square,3.0,"I recently visited a restaurant that had a great location and good food. The steak and frites were tasty, and the peppercorn sauce was great. However, the onion soup was underseasoned and watered down, and the duck was tough and chewy. The staff apologized and offered a replacement. Overall, it was a good experience with a nice atmosphere, like a real French bistro, which added to the overall experience. I also tried the crème brûlée, which was great and really smooth. Sometimes duck  can be tricky, it happens :)"

Food was delicious and great portions, we had some cheese, my husband had the fillet mignot & I had the beef bourginuon. Erica, the GM & sommelier gave us a good recommendation of wine, and stopped by twice to check in on us and also asked our names, very thoughtful & personable. Would love to go back here!"

We tried to flag down another waiter before the second one, but he completely ignored us and walked right by. When the food came, it was delicious. No complaints about the quality of the food, just the service left a lot to be desired. And extremely pricey for the lack of care from staff."

Boucherie Union Square,3.0,"We came here as part of Restaurant Week. The food was okay, but I can hardly understand how a salad and a pasta dish is $45. Pasta definitely needed a bit of lemon or something to cut through the fattnes of the cream. I asked for pepper. And my partner's food (not pictured) seemed to be a little too boring (pate and the sausage - not looking like made in house). Service was great and atmosphere pleasant. We love trying new restaurants for Restaurant Week but this was quite a disappointment. Next time we'll do better research."

Yesterday I was going to celebrate my 30th birthday there. I booked a table a week ago. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was told that the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes and all we could do was either leave or hurry. Although on the phone, when I booked the table, it was said that the kitchen will be open for 1 hour longer until 11pm! They called me that I was 8 minutes late - like we'll cancel your table reservation and since it's for 6 people, there's a $50 fine for 1 person who doesn't show up. As a result, I came and saw an empty restaurant and the fact that I had been deceived."

Boucherie Union Square,5.0,"I had never heard of or seen œufs meurette on a menu before.

..nor had my brunch friend who has spent plenty of time in France (whereas I have only been in Paris for 3 days as a budget conscious college kid ).

So I decided to order and try that dish.   While he ordered a Bloody Mary and the sandwich au bouef.

My real desire was the burger but decided I would come back another day for that one specially since it was a little bit more expensive. (Four dollars doesn’t sound like much, which is how much more the burger is,  but when things go over the $29 price then   that starts to feel too rich for my blood on a normal day and I’d rather save my money to make something really good at home then.

My brunch date might have also thought the same price wise because he too loves to cook and was originally thinking the Dijon mussels.

In the end my friend  really liked his sandwich,  enjoyed trying a new French restaurant. ..He and his family are normally regulars as Jaques in the Upper East Side… while I finally got to try a new French dish and enjoy the Christmas tree they put up that I love and adore every time I walk by each  winter.

I actually live not too far from the place and this is definitely my favorite of all the restaurants in terms of looks and vibes. But I have only ever been here once before. Came late one night in January nearly a year ago  for an espresso  while  a friend did  order the burger.  Another reason I held off on ordering the burger today is that I was a little surprised at how small the burger was. So that made the $32 seem even more expensive for such.  I know rents and costs of food and employee wages have all gone up. And Boucherie is a relatively high end fancy establishment.  But  still some things need to be said about pricing before it’s too late and everything in New York gets too out of control. Plus had the prices been a little lower we very likely would have enjoyed ourselves more,   ordered more and thus  ultimately spent  more.

Bon appetite mes amis!

(One last thing I have been quite impressed if not  very impressed with the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. Often times bug busy fancy place like this place don’t have such. So kudos to the restaurant owners and people who hire and manage.  Plus loved that I was lent a purse hook for my bag. All places should do that. )"

My party of 6 waited about 10 minutes on a Thursday morning without a reservation, which is not bad considering how many other parties I saw waiting as well. All their items were delicious and filling, even if it may not look to big upon serving. I also got a hot cafe meal which is basically a latte with honey and cinnamon - would recommend this if you're looking for a twist on a traditional latte."

It had a thick layer of cheese that was just a little too much cheese. The steaks were cooked perfectly, the fries hot and crispy, and the sauces on both steaks had amazing flavor. We waited for the waiter to notice we were done for a while until I finally asked another waiter for the check. The check we were originally presented with wasn’t out but when they came back they gave us the correct bill. Other than that hiccup, we had a great experience!"

Gramercy Tavern,2.0,"The inside of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. They did a wonderful job with the ambiance, and I loved all the floral displays. I was very excited to come here to try the restaurant week menu. I came for a celebration, which everyone in the staff wished me well so I appreciated that. I really liked the host, but I felt like my waitress wasn’t as attentive in the beginning of my meal. There were several times I needed something but she wasn’t around. Towards the end she was better at checking up. I also read other reviews and realized they did not give me things like the crudité or the red pepper dipping sauce for the bread. I got the restaurant week three course menu. I loved the beef carpaccio. The pork cutlet wasn’t really that memorable so I wouldn’t go for it. And I asked the waitress for her recommendation for dessert and got the apricot tart which I definitely regret because I did not care for how tart/sour it was. So basically only one of the three courses I really enjoyed. I’m not sure I would go back, especially knowing they didn’t even give me the full experience by not offering me the same things they offered others in these reviews."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"This was one of the most wonderful prefix dinners we’ve had in a long time. The servers, the atmosphere, and food with the wine pairing was pure perfection. Everything we ate was perfectly curated for the season. If you’re a seafood lover it’s worth a try. Highly recommend trying this out. I look forward to seeing their fall/winter menu. Make a reservation."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Had a delicious and reasonably priced meal here with excellent service.

Came here for lunch and the beet salad was so refreshing, ordered the fish as well which the kitchen split into two plates for me and my friend to share. The fish itself was tender with great flavors.

Will come back to try their burger one day!"

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"We went for the restaurant week lunch and really impressed with the quality and value of it. The service was impeccable. Food all tasted fresh and delicious, even the bread with the red pepper dipping sauce were amazing too.
The main entry was a bit too salty, and portion size is on the smaller side, but we added the seafood platter and ended up really full."

Every dish was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. Our experience was truly elevated by Danielle’s (Dani’s) exceptional service. She was knowledgeable, intuitive, and attentive, anticipating every need with thoughtful personal touches. Thanks to her, this became our best dining experience in New York to date."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,Had an absolutely fabulous in every respect Mother’s Day dinner here. Did the tasting menu (which thankfully has no “supplements”) and we picked 2 of each dish. Every dish was superb.  Service was particularly excellent. The Austrian wine by the glass is excellent.  Hard to pick the best dishes but the two fish courses and the lamb are just slightly better than their counterparts. The bread is amazing. Both desserts were excellent. Great atmosphere. Been coming here since it opened like 30 years ago and still one of New York City’s best.  Compares very favorably with other NYC prix fixe places in all aspects including value.

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"The food was excellent. I made a reservation about 3 weeks in advance just to be sure. It's a bit pricey, but it's a great experience and great treat. I ended up doing the wine pairing as well, and they did a good job at complementary flavors"

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"We dined in the dining room with the seasonal menu. The atmosphere of this restaurant is incredible. Loved the decorations, lighting, and perfect temperature. It’s dinner and a show because watching the perfectly timed execution of courses being served to tables near you at the same exact time is magical. Loved watching the service staff execute to great standards and seeing two people go to a table at a time to clean plates off at the exact same time. Some of the courses weren’t outstanding, but the dessert was by far the best course. The truffles at the end were a sweet touch and we were sent home with a lemon poppy seed muffin to take home!"

There are some places you can go to for special occasions where it can feel like any other day, but our server Miguel and the entire staff made our anniversary dinner feel truly special. Not only was the food amazing, but the staff also had such a thoughtful eye to detail and really took care of us throughout the evening. Thank you for a wonderful experience <3"

Gramercy Tavern,4.0,"The vibes were great and I liked most of the food. For apps, we got the roasted oysters, chicken liver mousse, biscuits, and beef carpaccio. The biscuits were by far my favorite and a must order. For mains, we shared the tavern burger which was very soft and the aioli it came with was delicious. The pork shoulder on the other hand was unflavored but tender, and I would not recommend it. The desserts were great; we got the chocolate pudding cake which was my favorite, ricotta fritters, and basil olive oil cake."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"We made a reservation for a weekday lunch with for our team. We arrived at our reserved time and were taken to our table  within few minutes. The restaurant was so beautiful inside with all the plants, flowers, rustic decor, huge bar, really created a wonderful tavern vibe.

We started our meal with soft and fluffy bacon cheddar biscuits. There were 4 of them in the plate. Having only one of those didn’t seem enough. For entree I had the Tavern burger. It was made with a thick paddy that had delicious flavor topped with melted cheese. The aioli sauce on the side was so good that it enhanced the taste of the burger. My coworkers loved their pressed chicken and meal ball dishes as well.

At the end, we ordered a bunch desserts including lemon cake, passion fruit sundae and chocolate cookie. Sundae was my favorite. It was so delicious, incredible flavor of passion fruit and vanilla ice cream. The cookie was little too sweet for me. But the lemon cake was pure quality.

Our server Jasmine was amazing. Did an awesome job throughout the lunch. Rest of the staff were also equally pro, filling water, cleaning plates, folding napkins, they were on top of it all. Everyone was super attentive and fully dedicated to their job. At the end they also brought us a small cake for our office celebration. So kind and thoughtful gesture from them. Overall we had a great team lunch. I was so pleased to see Gramercy delivered above and beyond my expectations."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Every time I've been to Gramercy Tavern, it's been an amazing experience. It's definitely a place to go with someone special or to celebrate a special occasion. I was impressed by the décor and atmosphere. I highly recommend the seasonal menu. The service was excellent, and our chef, Michael, did a great job explaining the food when he came over. If you're having dinner with someone, I suggest ordering both options for each course and sharing them. Everything was delicious in my experience. It is a fixed-price experience, and you can pair it with wine if you wish. Finally, it was fairly easy to make a reservation. If you have the opportunity, you should definitely check it out!"

Mama Carolyn, Mike, Jorge, and all the names we couldn’t catch (including the one with the impeccable penmanship!) my partner said the way he felt the whole evening was: “it’s like they already know me.” A heartfelt testament to all of your hospitality. Thank you for making us feel so warm and welcome, for accommodating my special requests and even adding special touches of your own. Not to mention the food, which I wish wasn’t over."

Gramercy Tavern,4.0,Awesome experience but for the money it is ok. We celebrated my daughter’s 21st birthday and had a lovely time together. The service was great. But 500+ for 2 people should be a more wow in terms of the food.

Gramercy Tavern,4.0,"We visited during Gramercy Tavern during Restaurant Week, which made it a more approachable way to try the menu, but I’m not sure I’d recommend it outside of that promotion, especially if you’re ordering à la carte.

The food was solid and well-executed, but nothing really wowed. It felt like a very safe, polished version of seasonal American cuisine — satisfying, but not particularly memorable. That said, the setting does elevate the overall experience. The restaurant is split into two spaces: the more formal dining room, which serves a tasting menu, and the bar room, where you can order à la carte in a more relaxed but still elegant environment.

Service was gracious and professional, but very slow. We ended up waiting quite a bit between each course — nearly 1.5 hours for just three dishes, which felt unnecessarily drawn out, especially for a lunch seating.

All in all, Gramercy Tavern is worth a visit for the atmosphere alone, and it’s a solid choice during Restaurant Week. Just temper your expectations a bit when it comes to pacing and flavor fireworks."

The pastry chef here is a wizard. This apple tart was insane, with the cinnamon ice cream. The dumpling dish I had was special as was the lobster salad.
The ribeye was too lean for my liking as you can see in the photos."

Gramercy Tavern,4.0,"This has been on our lists for now a long time and finally made it. Reservation is definitely recommended as it was quite busy

Food : We went with our friends so we tried quite a few things! To start off the meal we tried a salad, everything under the sun and beef carpaccio. Both were great and the flavours were delicate but quite fresh. The bread which came along with the carpaccio was soo good. For mains I tried the charred Broccoli and shared the pasta with a friend. The broccoli was yum and the flavourful though the pasta was a little too tart.

Service : Quite sweet and knowledgeable staff! They knew the dishes and menu very well and could explain each and every component of the dish

Ambience : Very beautiful and elegant interiors. Definitely a place to come for special events and meals"

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"🌟 Unforgettable Evening at Gramercy Tavern

Last Sunday evening, my friends and I dined at Gramercy Tavern, choosing the Seasonal Menu—and it was truly an unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, the staff’s warmth, kindness, and attentiveness made us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for. Every dish was full of flavor, with beautifully handcrafted sauces that tied everything together. The Citrus-Cured Char, Sweet Pea Agnolotti, Golden Tilefish, Lamb, and Sweet Potato Bread were all fantastic.
What truly stood out was the dessert: The Strawberry Sorbet with Ginger Foam Ice Cream was incredibly creative and refreshing. The Strawberry Pistachio Cheesecake, Caramelized Banana Tart, and mini cream-filled donuts had smooth, creamy fillings and were absolutely divine.
This evening wasn’t just a dinner—it was a celebration of love, friendship, and new beginnings. My dear friends celebrated my birthday and a new chapter for my husband and me. To experience all of that in such a beautiful setting made the night truly unforgettable.🧡
As we left, we were even given chocolate chip cookies and coffee cake—a thoughtful touch that stayed with us.
Without a doubt, Gramercy Tavern will remain my favorite restaurant in NYC—a place where every meal feels like a gift.👍😊"

I'd be interested in trying more menu items in the future."

Gramercy Tavern,4.0,"TLDR: Service / ambiance & decor were phenomenal, and meal had some great highs but was a bit inconsistent. Overall really enjoyed myself, and left stuffed / satiated, but would probably go elsewhere next time given the price point. That said, if you’re a vegetarian, this place is a MUST - the veg options were fire.

Drink:
- Flatiron Friar: strong and herby
- Alpine Daiquiri: super cool and refreshing

Apps:
- Cheese Plate: this was actually quite good (as a non-cheese loving heathen). Goat cheese went well with the jam and crackers, and the second cheese tasted the best individually (you know we tried everything Ratatouille style 👨🏾‍🍳)

Seasonal Menu:
- Crudité: Nice palette cleanser / refresher
- Fluke: Really fresh and flavorful, solid start
- Gnocchi: Great sauce and bites, was a fantastic portion
- Sweet Pea Agnolotti (v): My sis got this and it was crazyyyy
- Sweet Potato Roll: Really good! Lighter and fluffier than regular dinner rolls, enjoyed!
- Golden Tilefish: Did not like this, fish and shrimp were really bland and fishy-tasting for me
- Elysian Field Lamb: So good! Great recovery from prior course, and honestly by this point, I was about to explode
- Carolina Gold Rice (v): My sis loved this
- Apricot Tart: way way way too sour, the apricot was straight up inedible lol
- Chocolate Meringue Pie: def better than apricot tart, but again, berries were WAY too sour"

Gramercy Tavern,3.0,"This place must be riding its historic fame for so long that traffic and revenue are just falling from the sky and any incentive to innovate or impress is discouraged. Well tourists are still coming. Why bother? I felt like walking into a Texas ranch when I saw the silk flowers, oversized furniture and exposed beams on the ceiling. Ok so I thought this would be a hearty American meal with good portions. No! It’s actually a French tasting menu with five courses at $175. Let’s just say the level of refinement and sophistication is not there. The only thing French about it is the portion: tiny little serving built up on coarse rustic plates. Odd. Overpriced. Primitive. Service was the only thing that was memorable. For food, you have plenty of options in the big Apple!"

While we were happy with all of our dishes, the complimentary bread it actually what we'll remember about this meal. It was so fluffy and tasty! I got the dark chocolate cake dessert and my favorite part was the candied chestnut. I could eat a whole bowl of those - so good.
The service was also good - friendly and helpful; but not stuffy."

You will pay a pretty penny but it's worth going for a special  occasion or just to experience true five star dining in a comfortable and casual atmosphere. The five course seasonal menu is divine.

The prix fixe seasonal menu offered thoughtful choices for each course, and everything we tried was fantastic. The standout dish for me was the caraflex cabbage—it was exceptional.

Our server, Mike, truly elevated the experience. He was welcoming, patient, kind, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. While the food was outstanding, what I’ll remember most is the warmth and hospitality of the staff. It was a truly special evening."

Our server, Mike, truly elevated the experience. He was welcoming, patient, kind, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. While the food was outstanding, what I’ll remember most is the warmth and hospitality of the staff. It was a truly special evening."
Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"This has been the most impressive, amazing and my blowing experience I have ever had.
I started the beginning. My waitress was phenomenal on point, funny and charismatic. The Somalia was on point. But the food took the cake. I can't wait to be back. This has ruined every restaurant I have ever been."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"We had an incredible experience dining in the Tavern Room. Although we had to wait about 20 mins for our table to be ready, we had some drinks while we waited—and to our surprise, they generously comped them.

Started with the grilled flatbread with seasonal dips, which were all bursting with flavor. I had been looking forward to trying the tavern burger and it lived up to the hype. Only wish there were fries instead of potato chips, but the burger was so good it didn’t even matter.

I couldn’t leave without trying their chocolate chip cookie. It came out hot, served with a cute glass of chocolate milk on the side, and was just as amazing as everyone says. One of my favorites in the city.

The service was fantastic throughout the whole meal. Napkins were folded when someone left for the restroom, drinks were always filled, and recommendations were spot on. All in all, a great meal and I can’t wait to go back!"

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Miguel left us unexpectedly impressed with a quick lunch at the tavern! It’s the small things: splitting our burger, asking if we would like focaccia, being prompt with water and the bill etc.

Food was also amazing — get the beef carpaccio!"

Gramercy Tavern,2.0,"Tried the Restaurant Week menu. Nothing outstanding that I would really remember. But worst thing first, the duck had a weird taste, so gross that I had to spit it out on the plate. It just didn’t taste right, and I don’t know if the duck was sick or if it hadn’t been stored properly and went bad. Also not sure if Gramercy Tavern is aware of this because apparently, the dish has now been removed from the updated menu.

On that note, I also feel that the menu design needs some more work. The restaurant week is offering a mandatory three-course meal, but some of the dishes suffice on their own and becomes too overwhelming when served with other dishes. (That said, large serving size in most other cases is a pro.)

I also want to point out that the service is unbearably slow. We arrived at the restaurant at the reservation time, waited 10 minutes to be seated, and another 10 to receive some water and the menu. There was endless wait between courses, and you won’t really get service unless you aggressively wave at someone. The whole lunch ended up taking about 2 hours."

The lobster salad, butternut squash lasagna, the cabbage, the sirloin, and the chocolate cake were all divine! It’s lovely to dine somewhere like this where everything has been thoughtfully curated. Would definitely recommend to anyone having a special occasion!"

Gramercy Tavern,3.0,"This is solely a review for the prix fixe in the dining room.

Underwhelming food could not be covered up by excellent service and drinks. As it was my buddy and me, we ended up with almost every dish.

The cheese platter is a must-get, the shaved cheese was really good as was the meat. I also really like the cinnamon cookie.

The citrus cured char had great pop from the lemon and the roe, and a pea sauce that was tasty.

The sweet potato was really boring, nothing remotely special.

The dumplings were really bland, with chewy dough and meat on the inside that was missing seasoning. Same for the broth.

The agnolotti was nice but it was the same pea sauce on the citrus cured char so that was a downer.

The tilefish and red shrimp were really good, with a broth/sauce that was seafoody and spiced really well, fantastic dish.

The roasted asparagus was really boring and had the same pea sauce a third time. The pave was respectable but did fall apart a little more easily than expected.

The lamb was very good, high quality and rendered well.

The sirloin was one of the worst dishes -- along with the dumplings -- due to the same boredom. The meat wasn't really tasty or meaty, and I like rare steak. Avoid.

Neither dessert was worth mentioning, just a bit of sugar. Oh actually the sorbet on the cheesecake was nice, but the rest I wouldn't order.

Overall, I do not recommend, this was a really disappointing meal and especially for a Friday night. I now need to go re-test the bar to see if the burger is still good."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,The vibe at this restaurant are spectacular. The moment we walked in we were so impressed with the decor and atmosphere. The food was delicious (best burgers we’ve ever had). The drinks were also phenomenal and the service was great. We would come here again and are so happy we got reservations!

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Excellent service and fun pre-fixe menu for 5 items.
- loved the bread the most
- enjoyed the sirloin, although the portion was a bit smaller
- dumplings were okay; high expectations, given I frequently eat asian dumplings and they were a bit hard
- fish was excellent and not over cooked
- lobster salad was a treat and very nice opener
- cake was soft, but perfect with ice cream
- tasty chocolate at the end

Overall, very satisfied. Great spot for a date, reunion, or business."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Me and my husband had our anniversary dinner at Gramercy Tavern and its was truly spectacular.  We arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation but the host staff was wonderful, asked us to sit by the door and got us a drink menu to have drinks while we waited.  The decoration in the restaurant was charming, homey and upscale at the same time. When our table was ready our waiter (Mathew I believe) was absolutely wonderful.  He wished us a happy anniversary and explained everything to us.  The service was impeccable and quick.  When I ordered a second drink, it appeared on the table without me even noticing while I was talking to my husband. That old-fashioned was really delicious and expertly made.  I could find no fault with the food everything from the appetizers, to the entrées and the deserts were amongst the best food I have ever had. My Grilled Pork Shoulder showed me how pork can be prepared to be a world class dish, it melted in my mouth and the flavors were beyond explanation clearly using the freshest ingredients.   When we ordered the desert the staff made us really feel special bringing us a small and delicious cake for our anniversary and some delicious amaretto that paired excellently with the sweets.  The waiter even brought us a coaster and a clean menu for us to take home to remember our first anniversary by.

I have eaten at a lot of restaurants from mom and pop shops to expensive steak houses but Gramercy Tavern will always be the best dinning experience I have ever had."

We were old ladies and came for the 5pm seating - it was quiet in the dining room (packed in the tavern). Our sever Mary Beth felt like an old friend, finding shared stories while ensuring we felt celebrated and were satisfied with our meal. All five courses were inventive and tasty yet the spiked hot chocolate may have been my favorite.
A special night had at the GT!"

Gramercy Tavern,3.0,"Gramercy Tavern, a one Michelin-starred restaurant, is renowned for its burger, but my experience was a bit mixed. We started with the roasted oysters and duck liver mousse. The oysters were paired with Swiss chard, which added a bitterness I didn't enjoy, and the duck liver was more of a pâté than a mousse--something I could have easily skipped.

For the entrées, the server recommended the duck meatloaf, which turned out to be juicy and flavorful. Naturally, I had to try the tavern burger, but while it was decent, it wasn't the standout I had hoped for--it was a bit dry.

Overall, there's a good chance I won't be returning."

That said, their service has always been top-notch—thoughtful, accommodating, and even considerate of our anniversary. They handle delays gracefully, offering drinks while we waited. Overall, it’s a spot we happily return to every time we visit NYC!"

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Service:
Front of house was friendly and although we were early for our reservation, they seated us with minimal wait on a busy Thursday evening. Our server Caroline was on top of her game -knowledgeable about the menu and what goes into every dish. Attentive, friendly and a professional.

Food:
We ordered beef carpaccio, burger and shared the beignets. Everything was well seasoned and executed. The focaccia bread was to die for! Last but not least, my wife was in love with the honey cake and their pastry chef reached out via email with her recipe! Amazing gesture indeed.

Verdict:
I’ve dined in the more formal part of the restaurant but the tavern was a first. I personally prefer the casual dining experience and the a la carte menu.

Gramercy Tavern has been such a fixture of NYC dining for years and there’s no question why. Resy is a must."

Gramercy Tavern,4.0,This is a wonderful experience and I went in expecting a five star experience.  We had the 5 course menu and added an extra cavier option which was excellent.  The first 3 courses were excellent but the baked sirloin for main and chocolate cake were terrible.  The steak was the size of a saltine cracker and inedible.  It was a single piece of gristle that I had to sit out on the plate.  The chocolate cake option was edible but it was dry and tasteless.  The apple tart option was much better. Our server Morgan was wonderful and the service and ambience were 5 stars but for a $650 bill our expectations were higher. I’d go back and probable eat in the tavern and not dining room.

Of course, the service is exemplary. On par with the very best two and three Michelin star restaurants in New York. But that’s not what separates this place from the rest. It’s the people. From the staff (bar and waitstaff, door and coat check) to the back-of-the-house, to Yes - even Management (Shout out to GM Asher R. For making my experience great) - The people that choose a Career at Gramercy Tavern really, truly care about quality in every facet, and in a city where most restaurants just want to charge top dollar for “Hype” - Gramercy Tavern genuinely cares - about providing a great customer experience, at frankly, a great value. Show me another 5-Star restaurant in Downtown Manhattan that can give you an excellent dinner for two for ~ $150 (including a drink)…I’ll wait. Either way, this isn’t a competition. Gramercy Tavern doesn’t “compete” - they haven’t needed to for decades. They just deliver*

*not actual deliver, but you get it.

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Honest review of Gramercy Tavern:

I was happy to be notified by Michelin starred restaurant Gramercy Tavern! I had heard that the food is a must but an absolute must is the seasonal hot chocolate! Both the exterior and interior are majestic, the hostess at the door was very courteous and took me to my table where I was greeted by my waitress Anastasia. I started my meal with the hot chocolate of course and the Lobster salad with copious amounts of citrusy lobster, fresh broccolini, seasonal Meyer lemon, earthy flavored radish and an avocado dressing that definitely made you excited for the next course! My waitress then brought out a fresh sweet potato bread roll that I enjoyed while waiting for my main course the Hanger steak cooked rare to medium rare with a tender center with cauliflower, radicchio, and pickled Shallots. The hanger steak was acceptable but not exceptional. It had a flavor that I could not put my finger on but I believe it tasted sweet with a mellow citrus taste. It’s very rare that the vegetables outshine the meat but they absolutely did here! The cauliflower had amazing flavor, fresh crisp to it, the radicchio and pickled shallots pairs well together! Now the dessert, Im going to tell you right now….It’s a crime against humanity that not every soul on this planet will be able to experience that Meyers lemon cake with candied Kumquats and house made Pistachio ice cream!
That flavor profile took my taste bud on a glorious journey to sweet, savory every bite. The smooth pistachio house made Ice cream was the best I’ve ever had. My overall experience here was great, the highlight of this meal was the hot chocolate, and that Meyers lemon cake…oh and the exceptional service by all the staff but especially Anastasia! If you are in the Gramercy park area this is a great choice to dine."

My waitress then brought out a fresh sweet potato bread roll that I enjoyed while waiting for my main course the Hanger steak cooked rare to medium rare with a tender center with cauliflower, radicchio, and pickled Shallots. The hanger steak was acceptable but not exceptional. It had a flavor that I could not put my finger on but I believe it tasted sweet with a mellow citrus taste. It’s very rare that the vegetables outshine the meat but they absolutely did here! The cauliflower had amazing flavor, fresh crisp to it, the radicchio and pickled shallots pairs well together! Now the dessert, Im going to tell you right now….It’s a crime against humanity that not every soul on this planet will be able to experience that Meyers lemon cake with candied Kumquats and house made Pistachio ice cream!
That flavor profile took my taste bud on a glorious journey to sweet, savory every bite. The smooth pistachio house made Ice cream was the best I’ve ever had. My overall experience here was great, the highlight of this meal was the hot chocolate, and that Meyers lemon cake…oh and the exceptional service by all the staff but especially Anastasia! If you are in the Gramercy park area this is a great choice to dine."
Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"If you're hunting for the best burger in town, look no further than Gramercy Tavern. This beloved establishment has earned its reputation not just for its standout burger, which is undoubtedly the highlight of the menu, but also for an array of other equally noteworthy dishes. For instance, the beets with burrata are a symphony of flavors and textures, beautifully balancing sweetness and creaminess. At the same time, the grilled eggplant offers a smoky richness that perfectly complements the other offerings.

During my visit, I was particularly impressed by the burger. It was perfectly cooked, and each bite melted in my mouth, delivering an unforgettable gastronomic experience. I also appreciated the attention to dietary restrictions; as someone sensitive to eggs, I was relieved when our server, Angel, took the time to ensure my meal could be customized to accommodate my allergy. Her attentiveness and cheerful demeanor truly enhanced our dining experience.

The ambiance of Gramercy Tavern is warm and inviting, yet it feels cozy due to its intimate size. Because of this, I highly recommend making a reservation right when the restaurant opens to secure a spot in the tavern area, as this is where the casual yet vibrant atmosphere thrives. Just be sure to specify that you prefer the tavern seating over the more formal dining room.

To cap off your culinary journey at Gramercy Tavern, don't miss out on the dessert offerings—specifically, the cookie paired with their exquisite sorbet selection. It's the perfect way to end a memorable meal, leaving you satisfied and eager to return."

Gramercy Tavern,5.0,"Truly an incredible experience. We heard from friends for years we needed to try this place, and we finally were able to go. Each course was pristinely plated and tasted very good. Two of our party did the 4-course seasonal tasting menu while the other two selected items a la carte. Everyone enjoyed each course. If you aren't particularly hungry, I'd suggest going a la carte. We were absolutely stuff after the 4-courses of the tasting menu.

The service and atmosphere were the highlights though. One of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been in and the staff are very kind and attentive.

It is expensive, but definitely worth going for a special occasion."

OLIO E PIÙ,4.0,"Olio e Più served up a carbonara that truly stood out—the guanciale was perfectly crispy, the spaghetti was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was rich and smooth without feeling too heavy. We also tried the Bufalina pizza, which was good but didn’t quite make a lasting impression. The restaurant was bustling, which slowed down the service a bit, but the vibrant atmosphere added to its charm. On a warm afternoon, the outdoor seating is a definite highlight, offering a more laid-back experience and a refreshing break from the indoor buzz. The portion sizes were just right, and despite a few minor hiccups, the overall experience was truly enjoyable."

We had a lovely dinner at Olio e Più, the food was incredible. The pasta was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Truly one of the best Italian meals we’ve had in NYC.

Our waitress was very kind and attentive, which made the experience even better. We were seated in a section near the kitchen, which was lively, and on this particular night, very loud due to a birthday celebration happening at a nearby table. There was quite a bit of shouting and cheering, which made it hard to talk at times, but it was the only table available.

Despite the noise, the food and service were absolutely worth it. Next time, we’ll try to get a quieter spot, but we’ll definitely be back! 🍷🇮🇹"

OLIO E PIÙ,1.0,"The most disappointing part of our experience was the service. We arrived just a few minutes early, but the hostess greeted us with a cold attitude and told us we couldn’t be seated yet because we were too early. Even after I explained it was only by a few minutes, they firmly insisted it was because we had arrived ahead of time. As someone who usually doesn’t mind small things, I was genuinely at a loss for words. A simple “Sorry, we’re still getting the tables ready” would’ve made it more understandable.
Plus even after the food arrived, utensils weren’t provided, and the servers were too busy to notice for quite a while.

All the pasta dishes were overcooked and very sticky, making them overly rich and difficult to enjoy.

The most disappointing dish was their signature carbonara. It lacked any proper seasoning, the sauce had no cheese flavor at all. The egg yolk seemed like a decoration, and the whole dish was so mushy it was hard to even mix. That said, I truly appreciated that the waitress noticed my dissatisfaction and kindly removed the carbonara from our bill. The extra stars of the service are for her.
The squid ink pasta was just ok, but definitely not worth the price.

The truffle pizza was decently seasoned and generously topped with truffle oil, but unfortunately, it wasn’t baked through. you could still see the mozzarella in whole clumps. It felt rushed, likely due to overbooking and an eagerness to turn tables quickly."

• The bruschetta was filling and delicious - 5/5.

• The crostone all'avocado (avocado toast) was well seasoned and large - 5/5.

• The uova della nonna (3 eggs with prosciutto and asparagus) was just okay. There was very little prosciutto and wasn't too filling - 3/5.

• The olio burger was fantastic. It was very flavorful (also had pickled onions which is my favorite), well-seasoned, and the brioche bun was lightly toasted and a nice addition - 5/5.

• For all the dishes we had fries which were great: not too oily, crispy on the outside but soft centered, and lightly salted - 5/5.

• The mocha espresso martini was delicious - not too strong and a nice foam - 5/5.

• The iced oatmilk lattes were refreshing for the outdoors as it was a hot day. Perhaps a bit diluted and could've been stronger - 4/5.

• The waitress was great and offered our dog some bread and water (we sat outdoors) - 5/5.

Overall, it was a bit pricey (~ $60/person including tax+tip), but expected for this type of place. I would come back again to try their pasta!"

Desserts were a nice way to round out the meal. Nutella calzone was a bit heavier than anticipated, but still good!"

The food was incredible!! It was the best Caesar salad I’ve ever had! We ordered the truffle Alfredo special and would highly recommend. Overall an incredible dining experience and can’t wait to come back!

The food was delicious — I recommend the burrata, and each person at the table ordered a different pasta dish. Mine was tasty, though I expected a bit more for the price.

OLIO E PIÙ,4.0,"We came here for a dinner on a nice summer night. They have really nice outdoor seating and it didn’t feel over crowded the way they had set up the tables.

Ambiance: the vibe is really nice here. Especially when you can sit outdoors. They have a European cafe style set up that feels comfortable and upscale.

Food: We started with the bruschetta. It tasted fresh and had a nice balance of all the ingredients. I especially liked the olive oil added on the top as a final touch. They also gave us complimentary bread and olives which is always a nice touch. I asked for a spaghetti pomodoro and they were nice and accommodated the request. The pasta ended up being my favorite dish. The sauce was so flavorful and it was well mixed in with the pasta. We also got the pizza, it was good. Again the sauce was the best part of it as it was flavorful. The chocolate cake as dessert was a great end of the meal. I love that they drizzle the chocolate sauce right as they serve it.

Service: everyone was friendly and great about answering our questions. As the end we did feel a little rushed out but they were busy so makes sense.

Price: the food is on the pricier side and so are the drinks. We paid about $100/person, including food, 2 rounds of drinks, and tips.

Very interesting spot that got its hype over their “amazing” carbonara pasta a few years ago. The exterior & interior is beautiful architecture. So I’m glad I checked it out but not planning on going back.

My friend had a reso at 3 & called to move it back bc she was running very late. A guy told her she can just walk in and it’s not busy. Cool, so when I arrived a few later this woman tells me they are fully booked & no seats. That’s interesting..

There were two seats at the kitchen bar but they were kinda tight. We made the most of it, but that whole experience was weird. Our waiter was very nice and so attentive. And when he wasn’t available, we had another one. We both got the pasta bc it was so popular but it was just good. Idk if I’d say mind blowing, $32 good."

Warm, gracious, effortlessly kind—he turned a lovely evening into an unforgettable one. With every word and gesture, he made us feel not just welcome, but cherished. It’s rare to be treated with such genuine care. José didn’t just serve us—he elevated the whole experience, and truly made our day."

OLIO E PIÙ,1.0,"SCAM ALERT! Our waiter added an additional 7% tip on top of the 20% tip we added to the check - without telling us!! He punched the additional 7% in after we handed him the card terminal, and then didn't give us the receipt. When we asked for the receipt, it took them a while (thinking we might leave) then they brought it over and when we confronted them - they didn't even seem surprised! They didn't deny it or anything, just said they'll fire the waiter (no they didn't) and that Alex - the general manager - will give me a call later. Someone did call, but I doubt  he's the GM - maybe not even related to the restaurant, just a friend of the shift manager. I doubt this is a one off thing - it seemed so routine to them, and they were so prepared, that I bet they get caught regularly.
Check out my other reviews I give fair reviews and understand the challenges that restaurants have, but this is outright THEFT! And it's not like I changed their suggested tip or anything for them to ft bitter - they're just running this scam to increase wages.
BTW the food was just OK, didn't justify the price if anyone still cares about that at this point.

Olio e Più – A Gem in West Village!

Had a fantastic dinner at Olio e Più in New York’s West Village. The atmosphere was cozy and classic, and the food was absolutely memorable.

🍝 The Pasta Carbonara was a standout — rich, creamy, and full of flavor, with perfectly cooked pasta and a generous touch of cheese. The raw egg yolk on top added the perfect silky finish once mixed in.

🥩 The steak was tender and beautifully grilled, served with roasted vegetables that complemented it perfectly.

🥩 As a starter, the veal appetizer (Vitello Tonnato) was a hidden gem — recommended by the bartender, who was genuinely friendly and attentive. A refreshing and delicate start that balanced the richness of the meal.

🍸 Drinks were equally satisfying, with a solid cocktail list that paired well with the dishes.

Service was excellent — staff were attentive without being overbearing. The bartender in particular made the evening extra enjoyable with great recommendations and a welcoming vibe.

Would absolutely return next time I’m in the area. A perfect spot for a relaxing night out with delicious Italian comfort food."

OLIO E PIÙ,5.0,"I came to Olio e Più on a whim and left plotting my next visit. The tartufata pizza arrives straight from the wood-fire oven with an intoxicating truffle aroma and a blistered, paper-thin crust that somehow stays airy and chewy at once. The squid-ink pasta is equally show-stopping, jet-black ribbons tangled with tender calamari in a briny, silky sauce that tastes like the best parts of the Mediterranean shoreline. Cocktails are just as thoughtfully crafted.

Service was instantly warm, water glasses never dipped, and every course landed in perfect rhythm. But the real magic is the setting: between the leafy Greenwich Village sidewalk tables and the candlelit glow inside, the room practically hums with Italian trattoria energy. I’d come back for the food alone, but that atmosphere makes it unforgettable."

OLIO E PIÙ,4.0,We came without reservations on a Sunday night and were seating right away for a table of 2. Open window and open kitchen atmosphere made the night lovely. My bestie saw the carbonara on other reviews and had to order for herself. It was super fun to break and mix the runny yolk in. The bruschetta was really fresh with yummy sourdough bread. The pizza (mushroom and truffle) was very rich in truffle flavor and was delicious. Service was a little lacking but the food made up for it.

OLIO E PIÙ,5.0,"I had an unforgettable dining experience at Olio e Più in New York City. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, with a romantic, rustic charm that instantly made me feel like I’d been transported to a little trattoria in Italy. The food was nothing short of spectacular—fresh, flavorful, and beautifully plated. I highly recommend the Truffle Pasta and the Margherita pizza, both of which were perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.

What truly elevated the evening, though, was our wonderful waitress, Anela. She was incredibly attentive, kind, and knowledgeable about the menu. Anela made us feel welcome and taken care of without ever being intrusive. Her recommendations were spot-on, and she checked in at just the right times, always with a warm smile. You could tell she genuinely cared about creating a great experience for her guests.

If you’re looking for a cozy, delicious Italian spot in NYC with top-tier service, Olio e Più is it—and if you’re lucky enough to be seated in Anela’s section, you’re in for an extra treat."

OLIO E PIÙ,3.0,"My partner and I were excited to try this restaurant because of the reviews about their truffle fettuccine. However, overall we were disappointed by the food. We ordered the prosciutto and melone as an appetizer. It was overpriced for what we got which was 3 pieces of cantaloupe, each with a sad piece of prosciutto laid on it like a blanket. The ratio of prosciutto to melon was bad and the flavor was lacking. That appetizer itself was a 1/5. For our main courses we ordered the fusilli del cacciatore and the truffle pasta. They were both good, but I wouldn’t go back to have them again. The pasta itself was great (the fusilli was wonderful but some of the fettuccine was clumped together), but the sauces didn’t have as much flavor as we expected, especially the truffle.

The service was great, no complaints!

The atmosphere was good, but it was loud and hard to hear my partner from across the table. It was also rather cramped, so the space might be difficult to navigate if that is something you consider when going out."

The taco was absolutely delicious. The tortilla was fresh and tasty, the meat was full of flavor, and the guacamole was excellent. They also offer lime wedges you can add yourself, which is a nice touch.

There aren’t seats right by the stand, but there’s plenty of seating available in the market area nearby.

When we arrived, there was a line, but it moved very quickly, so don’t be discouraged if you see one!

Overall, highly recommended for taco lovers — you won’t be disappointed!"

LOS TACOS No.1,4.0,"On the third day of our NY trip we decided to check out Chelsea Market. After walking through the marketplace we realized that Los Tacos No. 1 had the biggest line. In response, we thought that it must be the best restaurant in the whole thing. So, though we were skeptical, we made our way through the line and put in our order for tacos. Coming from California, we are used to really good Mexican food, so my expectations were pretty low. However, this place was pretty solid. The salsa was great with the complimentary avocado sauce as well. The rest of the taco was pretty standard, definitely not exceeding expectations, but definitely satisfying our taco cravings as well. At the price it is a bit expensive, but it is not bad at all."

LOS TACOS No.1,5.0,I love tacos and I have tried tacos around NY and LA. There’s a lot of good ones out there to satisfy you. And then I read the reviews of this one. I mean how better could this be from the tacos I have tried before. They all seem similar in taste right. But this one came with a long line and lots of hype. So I decided to give it a shot and waited the long line. I ordered a few things and was surprised cause it is way better than I expected. You will taste the difference of the quality. ADOBADA is in a different level of taco goodness. Definitely far better than most tacos out there. Enjoy!!!

We moved through the line quickly and absolutely loved the food.  You can't go wrong with any of their menu options, but the adobada (pork) was an experience you should not miss.  Super friendly staff.  Be prepared to find a place to stop and eat because there isn't anywhere to sit near the taco stand."

LOS TACOS No.1,5.0,"Got you — here’s the updated version with the carne asada taco front and center:

⸻

If you haven’t eaten at Los Tacos No. 1 in Chelsea Market, I’m genuinely worried about your life choices.

This taco isn’t just food — it’s a religious experience. It’s the taco that sits atop my personal Mount Rushmore of Meals. Every taco I eat for the rest of my life will be judged against this one… and spoiler alert: they all lose.

The carne asada taco? Bro. It’s so good I legit considered proposing to it. I dream about it. I would fight a grown man in line for it. (And at Chelsea Market, that’s a real possibility.)

The tortillas are made fresh right in front of you — like a tortilla fairy just poofed them into existence. The carne asada is grilled to absolute perfection, like it got a pep talk from Gordon Ramsay and a hug from your abuelita.

If loving Los Tacos No. 1 is wrong, I don’t wanna be right."

LOS TACOS No.1,5.0,"When visiting Chelsea Market, trying the tacos from Los Tacos No. 1 is an absolute must. The tacos are perfectly portioned, making it easy to sample all three delectable flavors without feeling overwhelmed. My personal favorite was the adobo pork, which is incredibly tender and packed with flavor. Although there's often a line, don’t let that deter you; the wait moves along quickly, so you won’t be standing around for long.

The seating is primarily located outside, but the area is equipped with heaters for those cooler days, ensuring a comfortable dining experience. I highly recommend pairing your tacos with a side of their crispy chips and creamy guacamole, which perfectly complements the flavors of the tacos. When it comes to authentic taco experiences, nothing compares to what you’ll find here. Without a doubt, Los Tacos No. 1 serves the best tacos in the city!"

But when it came to the actual food, we were left disappointed. We ordered carne asada tacos both flour and corn tortilla versions, and honestly, the flavor was underwhelming. ~$6 per small taco, based on reviews we expected something special, but it just didn’t deliver.

There was no wait when we visited, and while it was crowded with tourists, the line moved fast. So we can’t blame a long wait or being rushed for the drop in quality. It just didn’t live up to the reputation.

We’re honestly a bit confused maybe it’s just us, since so many people seem to love this place. But for us, it was overpriced and underwhelming."

You pay and order first, and then, give your ticket to one of the servers to prepare your tacos with the following options:
- choice of corn or flour tortilla
- choice of toppings: onion, cilantro, salsa and guacamole

My favorite is the Adobada Taco ($5.25+), which is deliciously marinated pork.
They also have Mexican Coke in a bottle here, although they are a bit pricey. ($4.50+)

Afterwards, we went to Los Mariscos next door for some fish tacos."

LOS TACOS No.1,5.0,"So great!!! Tasty and perfect size. Got the ones with pork, chicken and steak. Pork was my favorite. Chicken was my wife’s. Three for each is plenty to get full.

There is not a lot of seating. But just take your tacos a bit further down the market. There is seating there.

Big recommendation!!"

LOS TACOS No.1,5.0,"Coming from California, when we saw the tiktoks on this place, we had to show up and see what the hype was about. They did not disappoint. The line was literally wrapped around, and we knew then that something great was happening here. We got great service by Maria G and ended up ordering a steak taco, chicken taco, and pork taco. And, of course, had some cokes. But the tacos were phenomenal. The pork tacos was a crowd favorite in my group, with the chicken tacos a close second. The salsa was amazing, and we were able to get it on the side for those who don't like spicy.
We would definitely eat here again, next time we come back to NY."

Nothing against TexMex, I like it also, but I wanted true Mexican tacos, and that's what I got. Stunning food for a very reasonable price. Just fantastic!"

The cashier and guy who took our tickets were nice. The ticket guy wasn’t rude but seemed annoyed or stressed. The kitchen is quite small for amount of ppl in in and orders as well as loud. The price especially for one tortilla shell vs two was a little high to me was $13 for 2 tacos. It is nice they have the classic sauce station with picante ajis etc free still. There isn’t anywhere really to dine in and was hard find even a place stand and eat all pretty dirty. But like I said tacos were great and 2 filled me well.

They had to perfect amount of staff working, to ensure fast service. We were the first people in line and the lineup became longer shortly after. Tacos were immaculate. The best tacos we ever had. I just wish they came with a number of them, instead of ordering 1. We thought if we made one order that it would come with a number of them, which is why we only ordered 2. we would’ve ordered wayyy more if we knew one order only came with one taco! This was our fault for not asking though. I also wish they had more seating and tables, as we had to eat at the counter just outside of Los Tacos, and it was a stand up counter type of thing. Overall, a must have when you are in New York!"

Manhatta,5.0,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience at Manhatta. We started the evening with drinks at the bar, and the view alone was worth the visit—panoramic, breathtaking, and the perfect way to set the tone for dinner. The bar team was fantastic, and the atmosphere up there is just stunning.

We were celebrating a special occasion, and the staff made it memorable. Despite already ordering two bottles of wine, they surprised us with complimentary glasses of champagne and an extra dessert at the end—such a thoughtful and generous gesture.

The food was excellent across the board—elegant, well-executed, and full of flavor. The whole experience felt elevated yet relaxed, and the service was attentive without being overbearing.

Would definitely recommend Manhatta for anyone looking to celebrate something special—or just enjoy one of the best views in the city with great food and warm hospitality."

Manhatta,5.0,"I’ve been to Manhatta a few times for drinks and it never disappoints. The views are absolutely stunning—almost 360° of the city since the restaurant takes up the entire floor. It feels like you’re floating above Manhattan with iconic landmarks in every direction. I love that one side has a lively, busy vibe while the other is much more quiet and romantic, so you can choose the atmosphere you’re in the mood for.

The cocktails are excellent, the staff is consistently friendly and welcoming, and I was pleasantly surprised that there’s usually little to no wait at the bar even without a reservation. Overall, it’s a beautiful spot whether you want an energetic night out or a more intimate evening. I’ll definitely be coming back to try the food."

Manhatta,5.0,"Visiting this restaurant was an unforgettable experience!
The breathtaking panoramic view of New York City alone is worth the visit — it feels like you’re dining among the stars. The food was absolutely exquisite: every dish was a masterpiece, beautifully presented and bursting with flavor.
The service was impeccable — warm, attentive, and genuinely caring. We were also surprised with thoughtful compliments from the chef, which made the evening even more special.
A perfect place for anyone looking to combine world-class cuisine with an unforgettable atmosphere. Highly recommend!"

Manhatta,4.0,I love the views from here! Very beautiful: the inside of the restaurant is wonderful. The service is great and they are really on top of it! I went for restaurant week and the food was very good! But it just wasn’t incredibly memorable so I took a star off. But I still had a great time.

Manhatta,5.0,"An incredible experience! From the food, to the views, to the service, there was not one thing I wish had been done differently!

The food:
We started with the Hamachi and Tortellini. The tortellini was cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce. It definitely stole the show and I would highly recommend ordering it.

Our waiter recommended the Dry Aged Duck, which I have never had, and I was so glad I went with his recommendation. Definitely going to add it to my palette. They also provided delicious bread throughout the meal.

Finally, the dessert. The best restaurant dessert I’ve ever had. Frankly, I don’t even remember the exact names, but they provided this cake like treat for my fiances birthday as well and it was incredible.

The service and view couldn’t have been any better and I definitely look forward to coming back for a meal. They also provided binoculars so you can see the city at an even more incredible view.

5/5 for Manhatta."

Manhatta,5.0,"The way I see it as a temporary visitor: you can either pay $50+ per person for some observatory tours, or you can pay $50+ per person for the same view plus some OK and somewhat inventive cuisine. We came in during lunch, had a drink each, tried their famous burger, and soaked up as much of the view as possible. Loved the binoculars, the informative and friendly staff, and of course, the unobstructed view of uptown, the three bridges, and the sweeping panorama which reminds me exactly why people fall in love with New York."

Also the view is amazing. You can see the Brooklyn bridge if you are seated at the right table. Although it is a bit loud and crowded, I would definitely recommend this place. This would be the ideal place for you, especially if you want to do fine dining without spending like $200 or $300 per person. Good place for special occasions!! Highly recommend. I've been living in the city for almost 10 years and can't believe I just finally checked this place out!!"

Manhatta,5.0,"Amazing views and fantastic service. Came here to celebrate my birthday, and it was perfect. A birthday card was a nice touch. You get to choose between 3 or 4 course tasting menu and also get a pre-appetizer and a pallet cleaner between main and desert. Everything was delicious and of course the presentation was beautiful. Magnifecent views most definitely add to the experience, especially if you are lucky to sit by the window, it is very romantic. Hope to be back one day."

Manhatta,5.0,"My skepticism is high for places that open themselves up to relying on the view provided by being 60 floors up in NYC. I am happy to report though that this skepticism was absolutely smashed by the meal we had at Manhatta. The food from start to finish was stunning, incredibly palatable and far more complex than every high-up eatery I’ve been to. Not to mention the service was truly impressive, and such a breath of fresh air having experienced sub-par service in the US for so long. Not a single element of the experience was waited on, and every server was so incredibly pleasant. Thank you Manhatta for shattering my expectations, and can’t wait to bring as many friends here as possible!"

Manhatta,5.0,"Elevated dining with jaw-dropping views—an unforgettable NYC experience

I recently had dinner at Manhatta, and everything from the ambiance to the flavors was absolutely exceptional. I did the 3-course prix fixe menu, and it was worth every penny. Each dish was beautifully presented and perfectly balanced in flavor—refined without feeling overly fussy.

🍽️ Menu Highlights:
• My appetizer was light and refreshing, bursting with seasonal flavors.
• The main course (I chose the [insert your dish if you’d like]) was rich, tender, and cooked to perfection.
• Dessert was both creative and satisfying—the perfect sweet finish.

The service was warm, attentive, and paced just right. The staff made thoughtful recommendations and explained each course with care.

🌆 Let’s talk about the view: Manhatta is located on the 60th floor, and the panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn Bridge are just unreal—especially at sunset. It’s romantic, modern, and makes you fall in love with NYC all over again.

📍 Location: 28 Liberty St, 60th Floor, New York, NY
💵 Price: The 3-course menu is $148 per person (as of now), and absolutely worth it for the quality, setting, and service.
✨ Perfect for: A date night, special celebration, or if you just want to treat yourself to a stunning evening in the city.

If you’re looking for a dining experience that combines elegant food with unforgettable views, Manhatta delivers on every level. Can’t wait to go back!"

Manhatta,5.0,"Being greeted off the elevator by name is a lovely way to start your experience, then there is also the incredible view that never gets old!
We sat at the bar and our bartender was lovely. She made recommendations that were on point and was engaging.
As great as the above may be… the burger is better!
I forgot to take a photo of it because it was gone almost no time.
The drinks and crudo was perfectly fine, but very pretty!"

Manhatta,5.0,"Through the years, I’ve been lucky enough to try many restaurants that left a mark in me, be it for an amazing dish, the kindness of a waiter, or some other detail. There’s lots of great culinary experiences to have out there.

But only one can be your favourite. Only one such experience can be defined as “the best”. Manhatta is mine. I will never forget dining here, the impeccably kind staff, the mouth-watering food I’ve tried, and the amazing views from up on the 60th floor. The three East River cocktails I had probably also helped a lot.

If you only have one fine dining experience while you’re in NYC, make it this one. You won’t regret it."

But: despite the attentive service and the detailed presentation of the food, it ends up being pretty… bland. Our party of four tried almost all combinations of the four course menu. We liked a couple of dishes (scallops, duck) but we found everything else wanting. The seabass and octopus were inferior to most Mediterranean restaurants. And the steak was inferior to most steakhouses.
Overall I am sorry to say that this restaurant is just a tourist trap. What a shame."

Cocktails were top-notch, backed by an extensive wine selection 🍷 , but a few dishes in the pre-fix dinner felt overpowered by heavy seasoning—particularly the grilled seabass with hazelnuts, razor clams, and trout roe.

Too many flavors masked the freshness of the seafood. On the other hand, the dessert was amazing and turned out to be an unexpected highlight.

Overall, it was a great experience, and I’d happily come back—especially to check out their bar & lounge next time!"

We were recommended this modern restaurant, perched sixty floors up in the financial district of the city, by a few friends living in the area still. I can highly recommend it. The food was exciting, tasteful and delicious, the service great and the view breathtaking. If you do not want to go for a several course dinner, it's possible to order a hamburger in the bar or drop by for a drink too. I do agree that Manhatta is a love letter to New York City. We will be back for sure 🥰"

A la carte is available at the bar, but tables are tasting menu only. 4 is the perfect group size for tasting the entire menu. A lot of great dishes here, but outstanding items for me were the scallops and the ribeye.

The cocktail menu is unique and has plenty of interesting options. The service was accomadating. There were 4 of us, the perfect number to taste everything on the menu, and they brought out everything ready for us to share.

There is also a beautiful Bar Room on the opposite side, ideal for an early evening drink with a view."

The presentation was lovely and there were a few little touches that we really loved (it was my husbands birthday and they left a card for him on the table, we asked for a nice view and they sat us next to the window, the downstairs hostess and upstairs maître d’ communicate really well and as soon as we walked in we were greeted by last name and great service, etc) However, The food was overly complicated and not well executed. It’s like the goal was to be as weird and different as possible even if it meant the flavors weren’t complimentary plus the entrees came to us cold.

Maybe just go to sit at the bar?

Dessert was 10/10 though, to be fair.

I’m still rating the restaurant 5/5 because I don’t think 4 is high enough even though it wasn’t perfect plus I honestly would go again, just definitely not for that same tasting menu."

Manhatta,5.0,The staff here are wonderful and friendly. Great views of the city especially during sunset. Seminar wine class on one side and walk around tasting on the other side. The elevators you have to press C to get to the lobby. Comfy seating area for people who need to take. Call or break.

Manhatta,5.0,"We stopped by this bar after dinner, hoping to get seats at the bar, which can’t be reserved in advance. We were worried there might not be any spots available, but we were immediately seated at a comfortable high table.

The birthday person in our group was treated to a beautiful ice cream dessert with a candle, and we ordered a couple more desserts as well – they were absolutely incredible! The quality of the ingredients, the creativity, and the execution were top-notch. You simply must try everything!

As for the cocktails – the main reason for visiting a bar – they were outstanding. The staff was friendly and welcoming, explaining everything with ease and a smile, and they took great care of us.

The breathtaking view, other groups celebrating birthdays, and the stylish crowd made the experience unforgettable!"

Manhatta,5.0,"We recently had lunch at Manhatta to celebrate our engagement, and the experience was nothing short of spectacular. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable—warm, attentive, and truly dedicated to making the occasion special.

The food was outstanding, with every dish executed to perfection. The flavors, presentation, and overall dining experience exceeded our expectations. A highlight was the thoughtful personalized touch: a handwritten congratulatory note, a delightful sweet treat at the end of our meal, and a prime window seat offering breathtaking views of the city.

Manhatta is more than just a restaurant; it’s an experience. Whether you’re celebrating a milestone or simply enjoying an elevated dining experience in Lower Manhattan, this is the place to be. Highly recommended!"

Manhatta,5.0,"One of the best restaurants I’ve been to so far. The food was decent, the service was satisfactory, and the view was spectacular. The moment we walked into the restaurant, I felt like the view alone was already worth half the price, and we were lucky enough to get a window seat. I would recommend arriving before sunset and finishing your meal after it’s completely dark outside, so you can enjoy your meal while slowly taking in the entire process of New York's million-dollar night view gradually lighting up outside the window. Small amuse-bouche dishes were served between courses, and we received a complimentary celebration dessert, which was a lovely touch. Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience, and I hope the quality of the food and service remains consistent."

We had dinner in the restaurant, and we ordered the tasting menu for four courses.
It was all absolutely delicious, with not a single issue. The food was as fresh as anyone could imagine, and the presentation was wonderful. However, if you're not that hungry, go for the three-course meal. I'll be honest; I was stuffed.
The dessert was truly delightful. I had the candy bar, and my friend had the pair. They were both nothing short of amazing."

We ordered two four-course meals, and every dish was absolutely exquisite. The view was breathtaking, and the service was truly top-tier—from the moment we entered the first-floor lobby to our final farewell. I was warmly greeted with birthday wishes by everyone—from the lobby staff and waiters to the receptionist—which made the evening even more special. A memorable celebration in every sense."

There was an attendant that guided me to the bathroom. Ha! I’ve never had that happen. The views are stunning. I got to see the Bronx, Queens, and Manhattan from the window while I was eating. It’s expensive but I think it’s worth every penny. I highly recommend for all. Just ensure the weather is at least partly cloudy to ensure you get a view."

Manhatta,5.0,"Food 9/10
Went for a birthday dinner. The hamburger was surprisingly good, which we ordered at night even though it wasn’t on the dining area menu. The team was nice enough to allow us to put in three orders, in addition to the three course meal we put down. I was so stuffed at the end. The red wine was very smooth. All three courses were very solid, the duck was my least favorite part, as I felt like it could’ve been more tender / flavorful. Their desserts were very delicious, so delicious that I forgot to take a photo. But the star of the show was actually the hamburger, which thoroughly shocked me. I usually never eat hamburgers, so I guess this was a very pleasant surprise

Atmosphere 10/10
Gorgeous skyscraper view of the city. It was beautiful to be seated facing north by the window, watching the sun set as we enjoyed our meal. Very spacious and sleek modern design.

Service 10/10
Amazing service and hospitality. A great experience."

A table for four was always surrounded by at least three waiters. Three or four courses, would recommend 4. Wine list is extraordinary long and exclusive, but 2000$ for a bottle, sorry but over the top. We enjoyed our diner, the drinks , the dessert, but sadly we annoyed the main waiter with a tip where he expected more. No goodbye or thank you. Your female colleague showed more respect. We enjoyed our dinner nevertheless and will always remember the sunset view"

The food was absolutely phenomenal. Each dish is a work of art, both in presentation and flavor. The way the staff described every course added to the magic. I also love the synchronized rhythm of the kitchen through the open view added another layer of excitement to our meal. Hearing the harmonious voices of the chefs as they prepared the dishes was like watching a live performance.

And the views!!!! Wow!!! The restaurant’s floor to ceiling windows offered stunning, unobstructed views of Manhattan. They even provide binoculars in certain areas so you can fully take in the cityscape, which was a unique and delightful touch. The combination of the breathtaking views, the sophisticated atmosphere, and the hum of the kitchen created an experience that felt both luxurious and intimate.

This was an incredible lunch experience. I can only imagine how magical the views will be at night with the city lights sparkling. This wasn’t just a meal, it was a moment to remember. Highly recommended."

From the moment we walked in the building the staff was very friendly and accommodating, we felt very welcomed and despite the fact that we arrived 30' earlier they put us in our table very fast.
The food was an amazing experience, we went for the 4 courses menu and a bottle of wine and we enjoyed every second and every bite of it.
They had arranged a very cute note for us as newly married and it was so thoughtful. Also, everyone congratulated us which made us feel very happy.
The only negative is that we didn't have the chance to enjoy the amazing view as it was raining that day, however, we hope that we will be able to do so during our second visit to the restaurant.
We highly recommend this place."

I really appreciate Manhatta for making our anniversary dinner so special and would love to come back soon!"
Manhatta,1.0,"Horrible experience at Manhatta. We arrived Sunday around 7–8pm under the name George, group of 4. They added us to a waitlist, then told us we could head up. Once upstairs, they made us stand around a random table, saying it would just be a few minutes. We waited 20 minutes with no attention at all. Meanwhile, other couples walked in and were immediately seated, others were even given water while waiting — but we were ignored. Completely shameful. We ended up getting up and leaving, which is something we rarely do. Very disappointing."

Manhatta,5.0,"Took my girlfriend on her first trip to NYC for dinner service. We had counter seats and went through the 3-course menu. From entry to exit: the service, food, presentation, views, organization, attention to detail, and comfort were top shelf. They carpeted to her allergies and made differences in selected dishes plus added a noticeable and well appreciated palette cleanser. The drinks were on point and delicious. A memorable night and highly recommending not only for visitors but also natives looking for an excellent time."

Manhatta,5.0,"I'd give 6 stars if I could.

Truly the best restaurant experience I have had in NYC (I have lived here for six years). We went to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and from the beginning every member of the staff that we interacted with greeted us by name and wished her a happy birthday. They gave us a special table in the corner with a fantastic view and left a handwritten birthday note for her. Throughout the meal the service was impeccable with multiple people checking on us, filling waters, getting drinks etc. The food was also INCREDIBLE. I can't recommend it enough. I will absolutely be going back. It's not a place that just rests on the fact that it has an amazing view. I would dine here again if it were in a basement!"

Manhatta,3.0,"Wonderful location. If you want to dine with a great view, this is the place you’re looking for. The food was only okay but the fish was fresh. Dessert was very good. Too expensive for what you get.

To the restaurant: You might want to reconsider the fork and knife holder shown in the attached photo. It’s not very pleasant to have it placed directly on the table."""

Manhatta,5.0,"We had a reservation for Saturday at 7:30pm, we called and advised we’re running late, arrived at 7:50pm and were seated right away. We weren’t too thrilled about the table since we really couldn’t see the city well. We asked to be moved, about 20 minutes into the dinner a gentleman came over and moved us to a much better table. The service here is outstanding. The food and views were even better. We will be back for sure."

Our second time dining at Manhatta — still a wonderful experience. Great restaurants have consistency, and that’s what this restaurant has. Food, service, ambience, and all the little details that make for a great time."

1803 NYC,5.0,"I'll get straight to the point. We went with a large group. We ordered the gumbo, the jambalaya, the burger, the French toast, The oysters and even a salad. I cannot tell you one thing that I didn't like. It was all amazing. My favorite was the gumbo and the oysters and the employees there were all really nice. I can't wait to go back again. I definitely want to try the shrimp Po boy."

1803 NYC,5.0,Great atmosphere in and outside. Reasonable prices. Service very friendly and fun. Escargot delicious. Shrimp plump and juicy with a great sauce. Paella a bit dry so they brought out a very tasty sauce to liven it up. The ribs appetizer was the standout falling off the bone.

1803 NYC,4.0,"My friend and I had a reservation at 1803 NYC at 5:30 on a Monday evening. I read some reviews about the restaurant being very loud, but if you go around this time, it is not that crowded. Interior-wise, there is a small discrepancy between the upscale vibe their decor gives and the appearance of the floors, walls, and bathrooms.

We split charbroiled oysters ($23), my friend got the jambalaya ($29), and I got the Louisiana pulled pork sandwich ($20). The oysters had a wonderful sauce that tasted like a zesty tomato base. My friend enjoyed the jambalaya and noted it had great flavor. The pork in the sandwich was tender and cooked well. However, I do like some type of smoke or bbq flavor in my pulled pork, and this fell flat in that regard. The fries were cooked perfectly, so they had a nice crisp.

Service was good! We had multiple check backs and quick service. Overall, I felt like the restaurant had great flavors at appropriate dinner prices. I would recommend checking it out if you're in the area, though it is not a restaurant I would go out of my way to return to."

1803 NYC,5.0,"1803 was southern comfort, LGBTQ pride, excellent service, and great cuisine rolled up in one. We were pleasantly surprised. We were warmly greeted and taken to our tables immediately. The ambiance is a rustic, welcoming almost homely vibe. None of the unnecessary flair that you find at other restaurants looking to trend.  We were greeted by a handsome young man named Calvin who was very mannerly and attentive. He took our orders and answered questions. The food was brought out hot and in a reasonable amount of time. The food was delicious and there had not a single empty plate at the table when we finished. The was a jazz band playing light music that was very soothing as it was not loud music-just mellow and smooth. Even staff who weren’t waiting on us conversed with us casually- not pretentious or over the top. The mood was so light the we didn’t want to get up but staying longer without ordering more would have been rude. If I am around the area I would definitely go back and I would say try 1903 and bring a friend or two. Only downside is that the menu is not extensive, but I guess that’s what makes them master the menu options to customers delight."

1803 NYC,5.0,Very tasty food. I went to their jazz brunch. The food was great and I liked the cocktail pitchers. Music was okay but an added bonus. It was not Dixieland jazz or anything you'd hear in New Orleans. It wasn't too loud for chatting which was nice

1803 NYC,5.0,"We came to 1803 NYC to celebrate my mom’s birthday, and had such a fantastic time! This was our second visit, and it definitely won’t be our last. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful—super friendly, attentive, and provided top-notch customer service. The rest of the staff was just as impressive—everyone was helpful and on point.

The food was delicious! We especially loved the ribs and the charbroiled oysters—they were packed with flavor. The mac and cheese was a standout for me: rich, creamy, and so satisfying. The gumbo and brussels sprouts were just okay, but everything else more than made up for it. A really thoughtful touch was when they surprised my mom with beignets for her birthday—they were warm, sweet, and really tasty.

Overall, it was a lovely dining experience with great vibes, great food, and great service. We’ll definitely be back."

1803 NYC,5.0,"I had an absolute great time at 1803! I’ve been twice, once for a date night and the other for a girls night and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The drinks were amazing, my favorite was the sidecar and the frozen grenade. I was lucky to get the happy hour special so it was $2 off all drinks! The food was delicious and very well flavored. I had the xo noodles and the charbroiled oysters were to die for!! I Will definitely be back again soon :)"

1803 NYC,5.0,The food was delicious. Everything was seasoned to perfection. Taste and full of flavor. They have a special sauce that is drizzled over the food and it tastes amazing. My collared greens were pretty good. The hostess was so inviting. Made you fell like you belong to the restaurant.  Very nice experience.

1803 NYC,3.0,"Went there for lunch with my girlfriend and ordered two simple Caesar salads. They were around $17 each, but really just lettuce, some cheese, and croutons. If you wanted to add shrimp or chicken, it was another $14–15 which would bring the salad to nearly $30, which felt way too much for what it was.

The fries were actually pretty good (about $9 for a basket). In total, we spent about $60–65 for a basic lunch, which seemed steep for what we got.

Service was fine, nothing memorable. The interior was quiet, beautiful view, nicely designed, and very clean that was probably the best part. But based on the price and food quality, I’m not sure I’d go back."

1803 NYC,5.0,"Absolutely loved our brunch experience here. The vibe is fun and I’m happy I could hear my friends over the music. Was also happy to hear that none of the food is actually spicy and so I chose the chorizo purgatory with confidence. Staff is friendly, super helpful and checked in with us often. My friends got their drinks but I opted for a coffee and can say I enjoyed it."
