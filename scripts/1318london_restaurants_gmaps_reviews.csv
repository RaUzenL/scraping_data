hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"Wow! We were really impressed. We weren‚Äôt really expecting much due to the price, but this was amazing! The room was a decent size with lots of storage space. There was also a smart TV as well as LOTS of plugs and USB ports for charging ‚Ä¶"
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"I have had an excellent stay here, second time with Hub by Premier Inn and first time at this location. The rooms are cosy and well maintained. Cleanliness was great, beds comfy, complementary bottle of water every day. The rooms have a perfect size for a solo traveller like me, I would say for a couple the space might be a bit tight. It's also very quiet in the hotel so I got a good rest and night's sleep.

The team is extremely friendly and they allowed me to use the hotel address for online shopping, which was convenient for me as a non UK resident.

The location is a bit of a walk from the station, the area is safe though. The connections from Farringdon on the Elizabeth Line are very quick and convenient. I'll look forward to future stays with the Hub."
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"Excellent value for money, nothing else like it in the area. Very clean rooms and lounge area. All you can eat breakfast very nice. Location is lovely, beside Exmouth Market. Large room. Quiet enough to sleep well. Comfortable bedding and heating/air con. Staff very friendly. Compares to 4 star hotels in my opinion. Highly recommend!"
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"Very satisfied with our stay at the Hub.
The hotel was happy to store our bags prior to check in.
The room was spotlessly clean & the beds were comfy (though we did request extra pillows).
The nighttimes were peaceful & there was a black out blinds on the window.
All the staff, including the duty manager & chefs were very friendly & happy to accommodate my partners dietary requirements and the bar/breakfast are was comfortable.
The location was very convenient, as was the 12 noon check out time.
I would note even the larger of the rooms are on the small side & perhaps more suitable for a single person and I found the way the lighting in the bathroom was connected to the lighting in the room a little odd."
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"This was a wonderful and comfortable stay.

The staff were so welcoming and friendly with an excellent coffee whilst we waited for our room to be ready.

The hotel is in an excellent location, right next to Exmouth market that has great restaurants and shops.

The rooms were basic but comfortable, spotless and well designed. The windows were designed to block out any noise making it completely quiet. It did feel a bit stuffy but was okay when you changed the settings on the air conditioning.

Will be coming back."
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"Easy self chick in. Small but perfectly formed rooms,with comfy bed. Would be nice to have a kettle though. 24hr bar is a plus - we went to a gig, so was nice to be able to come back for a drink. Breakfast was fine - although staff were a bit slow to restock food and crockery/cutlery. Good location for train station.... Will come again"
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,We had a great experience. We bought early check in from 11 to be able to drop our bags off for the day. The hotel is nice clean and modern and has a nice bar. The location is great and is a quick walk to the Farringdon tube station and modern Elizabeth line tube which have nicer trains with good air con. The staff were friendly and overall great stay for the price
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,I love the Hub by Premier Inn hotels and this one was no exception. Excellent location near King's Cross and Farringdon. Comfy bed and very clean. No kettle in the room but you can access hot drinks for free in the bar area. Basic breakfast but everything you would need for the price. Did self check in but the staff seemed friendly too. Nice and quiet room. Highly recommended.
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"Excellent stay. Check in was prompt. Room cleanliness was 10/10. All staff really friendly and welcoming. Exmouth Market is a very short distance with lots of cafes and eateries. Short walk to tube station at Farringdon, with direct access to Wembley. King's Cross is around 20 mins walk.
Would definitely stay here again when visiting London.
Thank you"
hub by Premier Inn London Clerkenwell hotel,,"Fab hotel, ideal base for exploring London. 20 min walk from King's Cross. Hotel clean & modern. Staff helpful. Breakfast was great for ¬£8, would highly recommend rather than traipsing round looking for places to eat. Eating & bar area very clean & food items topped up regularly."

The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"We were celebrating our engagement with a Champagne Afternoon Tea.
The sandwiches were so fresh, the Scone and Cakes were delicious.
We chose Darjeeling Tea which was soooooo nice!!
The only thing I would say is, we were sat for almost 35 mins before we got our food, then another 10-15mins until the pot of tea arrived.  We found we had to slow down the eating in order to enjoy everything together.
It‚Äôs within a beautiful building that also houses shops such as Boodles, Omega and Tiffany‚Äôs and the Engel bar."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"A Wonderful Place for a Snack
The Big 3s:

Ambience: nothing better than this area and surroundings

Service: a few in the morning sharing duties but the Mr. from Peru was the nicest who also told me about discount in the store with my receipt; the Italian girl also kind; the British gentleman told me I could not get brown toast for my Welsh Rarebit since ""it's already premade"" which doesn't sound very appetizing

Food: 6 out of 1-10 as it's just super simple on a dish and white bread at that

Unique Point: for same day to the store adjacent we save 10% for being a customer of the restaurant bar; unsure if the same is true if you shop in store to get a discount back in the restaurant"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"I came here with a colleague after work. I ordered a glass of champagne, scotch eggs, and a side of salad, and I loved it. Simple but good food and champagne in a beautiful setting. This, plus the good company, made for a wonderful evening, so a 5 stars all around for me."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"I'm so glad to have chosen this restaurant for our recent visit to London.

The atmospheric surroundings from the old building were amazing. The food was magnificent, and staff were all supper helpful and brilliant."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"A fantastic spot for a glass of champagne in a truly historic setting! Located within the iconic Royal Exchange, which dates back to 1571, Fortnum‚Äôs Bar offers a refined atmosphere surrounded by luxury boutiques.

The bar is open Monday to Friday from 7:30 AM to 10:30 PM, making it a great choice for breakfast, afternoon tea, or an elegant evening drink. The service is impeccable, and the selection of Fortnum & Mason‚Äôs signature drinks and light bites is excellent.

Sitting under the grand arches of the Royal Exchange while enjoying a chilled glass of champagne is a wonderful experience‚Äîperfect for a break from shopping or a stylish catch-up with friends. Highly recommended for those who appreciate history, luxury, and great hospitality!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"A great bar to come and chill for a drink with colleagues, friends, and family. It‚Äôs nice to sit among locals and enjoy a nice cup of tea or coffee. The seating at the bar was quite comfortable (although we would‚Äôve preferred to sit at the tables with the nice blankets ‚Äì this seating was reserved for patrons who were eating). We stopped here for tea and a latte after spending time at the Bank of England across the street. I love this tea so much that I had to buy more at the F&M store next to the bar. The bar staff were extremely friendly and they were quick to serve and clean the area.
It was an amazing experience to sit at the bar, enjoy a fresh cup of tea and stare at the store and lovely architecture surrounding you."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"The tea is very good, but the customer service is 1 star.
When a customer dropped the menu list on the floor, the waiter stepped on it and put it on the desk without replacing it.
Also, water is refilled for Caucasians but not for Asians (not racist, but I feel there is some kind of difference in service delivery to customers)
There is also a
store in Tokyo, so I thought about going there, but I won't be going there anymore,"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Best table service I've had outside a Michelin star restaurant. Excellent drinks and food, would love to visit again. Had the fixed price menu and chose the Scotch egg, steak and knickerbocker glory, all were fabulous and better than expected."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,Such a beautiful setting. Service impeccable. Thank you making things so special for my friend and I üëçüèæüòé
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Great building. Great food.
We had steak (+¬£8), chips (+¬£6.50) and vegetables (+¬£6.50).
All food was tasty but be prepared to pay a bit extra for drink and sides."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"Lovely experience using my virgin experience voucher for 3 course dinner.

The set menu options were quite varied. Ordered the Beetroot salad and renowned scotch egg, both lovely.

Then had the steak with peppercorn sauce, quite different, sauce was sweet but delicious and steaks were cooked very nicely.

For dessert we had the crepe suzette - nice experience watching this cooked tableside. And the brownie which was very warming and super chocolatey.

Staff were also attentive and friendly.

Location is lovely, just bear in mind it's a little dark at night as the lighting is only from the dimly lit lamps."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Great experience and open area to enjoy your meal
According to the staff everything on the menu is popular"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,We got gifted a virgin experience to come and eat here and it was lovely. The ambience was great and the service was really good. The beer selection was the only let down for me.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"Well I used to love this place. The food is excellent and the people are lovely. Except today.  It was 10% occupied at 9am. I am unable to perch on the high stools due to an injury. I wanted to meet a friend for coffee, but was told the tables were all taken. They weren't. The maitre d' would not hear me. We went somewhere else."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"Tourist Trap. Avoid.

Wonderful atmosphere, nice staff. Unfortunately the afternoon tea set was terrible. We were both nauseous after the food. The sandwiches were not fresh. Been made and left out too long. ¬£50/per person yet they cannot manage a decent sandwich, it is pretty inexcusable. Pastries were also overly, sickly sweet and not fresh. Soggy even. Massive disappointment."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"5 Stars Luxury Experience! We booked with the Virgin Experience for our 2nd Anniversary, we had a delicious and amazing dinner, the food it's incredible tasty and the service is more than perfect! The waitresses were so kind and helpful and they offer us a dessert for our anniversary. They have been amazing and we loved everything!! Absolutely recommended as a restaurant if you want to have a special moment with someone you love. Thank you for this amazing dinner!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"Gift from friend for our Wedding Gift from this Virgin experience day üéÅ Walked in each to their own preference the claimed ""most instagramable"" I didn't think it was wow factor. There's 4 entrances and the seatings your placed kinda right in the middle, 360 surrounded by luxury jewelery shops with some Fortnum and Mason kinda bit exposed from my view, strangers walking past because anyone could walk in and not sure who prefers that (also the chairs were not comfortable at all and our table was unbalanced so it was wonky). In-addition, if you're like first time visit your kinda lost where to go cause there's not really a recognised reception point so you kinda just walk towards a member of staff to ask. Food selection was alright for my selection and happy to pay extra. But partner had this steak (Medium Rare request but more Medium Well) with Pepporncorn sauce tasted weird with a fishy trout taste, I'm unsure of this reason but she didn't want me to raise the issue for ¬£15 additional expected something better but I guess it's Bank, location location! Service greeting was friendly at all times, but there were some like serving staff that was a bit like okay... example I ordered a big sparkling bottle of water to share, opened it poured it for us very nice but then took the lid cap away leaving the bottle of sparkling exposed throughout the dinner of Service. I expected better as imagine paying ¬£85 already then topping up another ¬£50 on top including the service charge (we ordered extra food) for 2 ppl but I guess this is standard for Bank again. Oh the cocktail üç∏  was not for me, the Pale ale was nice though üëå Overall, experience didn't do it for me üòÖ but you can't please  everyone, try it for your own point for view."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"Had a champagne afternoon tea for two here and enjoyed the experience for the most part.
It was difficult to find space on the table for everything, and it felt a bit strange to be in the middle of the room here with events going on upstairs though. The food was also not the best afternoon tea food I've ever had - it was by no means bad, just a bit plain."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"The food was good not the best I've ever had but the location and attentive staff more than made up for it. We had a set menu as a present (¬£100) but still paid for extra and drinks, it cost about ¬£65. You could do it for the cost of the voucher and it would be very nice. Over all I would have to say I've had better for less."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"It‚Äôs a shame that such a beautiful location doesn‚Äôt have nice service.

Server literally forgot to add the food snack I requested, upon my reiterated request, he fuzzed off ‚Äúit was not charged‚Äù and tried to order it again, in vain, he forgot again.

Tried to enquiry him information about the menu, impossible.

Noticed preference towards regular customers, which is a shame as I am also a local but first timer here, which may be the last, at least wouldn‚Äôt recommend the bar.

the policy of having tables only for dining is absurd, sometimes you start with drinks and add food later, you are self limiting your customer‚Äôs taps by arrogant staff attitude"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Had a wonderful 3 course meal here, which was part of a gift voucher package.
The staff were very attentive and there was a good chance of dishes.

The food was amazing and such good portions."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,3.0,"This branch is located inside the Royal exchange. Its not as grand as the actual branch but it still offers a lovely vibe. The place is beautiful especially with Christmas decorations. Stopped there for a quick coffee. Service was good and coffee was great, we had Americanos. However, the price is just too much for a cup of coffee."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Tasty dinner in a beautiful building with friendly and professional service. We enjoyed all our dishes especially the scotch egg and the sea bass. Both desserts were good too. The crumble topping on the apple and rhubarb crumble was the lightest and crispiest crumble I have had. A classic British dessert stylishly delivered.

Special thanks to our waiter Roy for his attentive service with a smile."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,2.0,"We made a reservation for 13:45, intending to enjoy a two-hour period for both lunch and afternoon tea. However, we were denied the opportunity to order afternoon tea, which is available from 14:30 onwards. When we inquired about the restriction, they explained that our reservation was specifically for lunch, not afternoon tea. It struck us as odd ‚Äì how could they assume we wouldn't be interested in afternoon tea following a light lunch?

Moving on, the Scott eggs had an average taste, accompanied by heavily Maggie's seasoned powdered defrosted peas and carrots.

The interior was stunning, and the location exudes a cool vibe reminiscent of the financial district in downtown Manhattan. Numerous iconic landmarks are situated nearby. Only the lunch wasn't giving."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Had an evening meal here through Virgin experiences. We really enjoyed the experience which was very relaxed and casual. The building itself is stunning. The food was delicious, all of it was great quality, although the options were a little limited. The staff were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. We were even late for our booking but staff made sure all of our courses were prepared before the kitchen closed."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"Afternoon tea with a touch of Xmas in the stunning al fresco-style surroundings of the Royal Exchange‚Äôs spectacular central courtyard with bonus stars lights display probably only in December was well worth the price. Gingerbread mini loaf, pistachio white chocolate bauble and violet choux were nice but not the best, however sandwiches were of quality and scones served with lemon curd in addition to jam and clotted cream were well made. Service was fine. Recommended."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,2.0,"had afternoon tea here and service was terrible. front of house/manager and servers were unfriendly from the beginning and acted as if they did not want to serve our table and would rather serve others. they did not greet us, and served us carelessly and ignored our table multiple times. my expectations of a f&m were sorely unmet, and would rather patronise other places for afternoon tea with better service overall."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"The classic afternoon tea was proper. The service was perfect - discreet, agreeable, and attentive - and the place is stunning. Even though everything was quite good, the food was not extraordinary to be honest (you'd expect almost perfection from such a place).

For ¬£35 as of February 2023 (very pricey, but with the past few years' inflation it is sadly currently one of the least expensive luxurious afternoon teas you can find), you get 5 sandwiches (e.g. smoked trout, cucumber, egg, ham, curry), 2 scones with clotted cream, lemon curd & strawberry jam, and 3 mini pastries, along with a tea to choose from a selection.
Scones and jams were delicious, but the sandwiches could have had more fillings given the slices of bread - very good - were quite thick. Being French I found 1 of the 3 pasties was delicious while the others were just fine.

They don't tell you that there and the website doesn't say it either, but at ¬£35 it's good to know that you can ask refills of whatever you want for no extra charge. The price also includes a tea tasting. It's best to not go too late before the end of the service to make sure you can actually get refills and taste different teas."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Lovely staff, in relaxed up-market shopping mall eatery and bar, great to dine in such an open large space and admire the architecture. Like most diners we ate with the Virgin experience dinner mene, good selection and great cocktails."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Gorgeous spot for intimate dinner with a delicious cocktail and wine selection and well seasoned dishes. Definitely go for the three course dinner. The ambience, the service, and the food were all top notch. I will definitely return!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic.
Food and service was outstanding üëå you can add to the menu for a few pounds.
We had 2020 Argentian Malbec and it was beautiful.
Location was stunning üòç
Staff who served us where a credit to the company.
Highly recommended üëå"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"I tried a small plate as I wasn't too hungry - I had the beluga which comes with a nice presentation, and scrambled eggs to your liking, cooked on an arriving trolley.  Excellent with a nice glass of champagne.

With the Royal Exchange behind as a backdrop, one cant really complain, can one?  Recommend this place for a nice high end drink for meeting and chatting with friends or family."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"Gave 4 overall as we were sitting near the door and every time it opened a cold gust of wind came in.
Staff advised there was nothing they could do other than provide a blanket"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Enjoyed a really lovely meal here, definitely retains  the class, charm and pomp of the St James‚Äôs location and that helps sell the experience of a quintessentially British menu. I ordered here the Dorset crab and the calves liver and bacon, both of which were delicious but the liver really stood out to me as classic comfort food.

The staff were all friendly and attentive if a little slow in service, but you really can‚Äôt fault it.

Would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,We had afternoon Tea at this place. It was brilliant and very tasty. The Tea flavours was fantastic and the scones was best of all the choosings. And after the Tea go to the shop and buy the Tea in beautifully boxes
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,Beautiful buding and extraordinary location. You feel royal having a cup of tea or English breakfast here. Accomodates to dietary requirements. The building is a little bit cold like a typical old building or museum so I always bring a silk cashmere scarf from Hermes as a blanket when eating here. The toilets are downstairs to the left directly after the entrance in case you dont like asking for locations. There is a Fortnum & Mason gift shop next to the restaurant where you can buy great teas and high end biscuits or jams. The shop is much more luxurious and peaceful than the original stressful shop near Green Park. We hosted an engagement dinner here one evening as there was live music in the large building with great accustics while dining. I hope this helps. Kindest #ingavardhan
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"This little outpost of Fortnum & Mason is like one of those London secrets you don't want to share. The location is outstanding. The champagne is delicious. It's got the feeling of a first class lounge - classy, quiet, relaxed and just a touch indulgent. All the things I love. The oysters are fantastic, as is the service. And on top of all that, I think it's extraordinary good value for money."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,3.0,"Popped in for a drink last night whilst checking out the area around The Ned where we are staying this week.

The bar staff member that served us couldn't understand my BBC Scottish accent, which is fine. But he just looked annoyed that we were there. Not the best service or experience really considering how lovely all the other F&M venues are.

The floor staff were lovely and courteous.

Very good Espresso Martini."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Giving the service 4 because the guy who sat us was big and gruff (not smiley)but perfectly polite (had a nasty cough unfortunately). I just would‚Äôve preferred a more genteel type of service. Also very very strong wind and cold because of the v big automatic doors on 3 of the 4 walls!  They provide a blanket for your lap, however it‚Äôs an uncomfortable picnic blanket (plastic
On inner) to put around your shoulders when your back is to the doors!!  Could be a snuggly throw? The food was delightful and it‚Äôs a stunning venue which I would recommend. I am a little picky!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,Fantastic spot for lunch in the City. Food and service were exceptional. Ordered the fish and chips and my friend ordered the Chicken Caesar- both were great. Highly recommended for lunch.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,Waited 15 minutes after being seated to be acknowledged. Totally ignored by various members of staff when the place was not even full. Gave up and left for some place better.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"The staff are awful, we stand at the entrance waiting for a seat and no one cares about us. Even if they notice us and don't wanna greet us.

So disappointed with that and we decided to just turn around straight away. Hope not related to discrimination because we got an Asian face?"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Had a great experience, the food was lovely, however, the main course was only warm rather than hot.
Everything else was superb."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,Amazing building here! It was quite interesting to have afternoon tea in Royal Exchange. But I was disappointed to say the food and tea was below Fortnum & Mason standards.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,2.0,"Fortnum & Mason has a reputation for great food as somewhere so when I found out they had a restaurant in the city I was very keen to go. Unfortunately we left disappointed with our experience. Firstly, the menu we were given on arrival was different to the one on their website (I was particularly looking forward to trying the Beef Wellington which appears on their website in the Dinner menu). The woman, who I believe was the manager,
said ‚Äúwe changed the menu today‚Äù. We asked for some recommendations and I decided to go for the shrimp burger, however, this was out of stock. Finally, my third choice was the Lobster spaghetti, which although at least available was quite tasteless. The whole experience was pretty underwhelming and not what you‚Äôd expect from Fortnum‚Äôs. The only good thing was the service from Arthur, who was very friendly and helpful, and served us a lovely tea at the end."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,My favorite place for a cocktail close to my office. Everyone I bring here loves it.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,Was a great experience the locations was really nice and had a good atmosphere. Teas selection was really good and different the sandwiches and cakes was standard
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Patricia is a fantastic example of exactly what an attentive and professional waitress should be. Humorous and generous, made the experience very enjoyable."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,2.0,"Usually I don‚Äôt go to such a touristic place to eat. But I know that F&M has a very good lunches and wanted to take my parents there for an afternoon tea. Our plans changed and I‚Äôve rescheduled the table for earlier time just for lunch. As we arrived there we were not too hungry to have a full lunch but wanted some starters and drinks. The food was great. But. The service is so awful!! The guy first gave us only lunch menu. I then asked for drinks menu. Hi gave it to me after 5min waiting (and the place was not too busy). We wanted to have a look at deserts and I needed to ask for menu again. The guy was already not happy. But come on, we may order whatever we want!
The guy was grumpy when we asked for second blanket (it was very chilly). My dad had tea (loose leaf in teapot). I asked waiter if we could add some hot water, he took the teapot and threw couple of words leaving the table ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do this here‚Äù. He may just told us in a kindly way and explain. In 5 min he brought a new teapot and add it in bill.
The atmosphere was already ruined.
When we asked for a bill, I decided to check it. They added items worth ¬£30 that we didn‚Äôt order!
How come such a well known place couldn‚Äôt manage their stuff to be more friendly?
Disappointed."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,3.0,"The food was great, good selection and amazing presentation. The quality of the service really lacked even meeting some the basic standards. We waited about 30min before being able to order our food, we tried numerous times to make eye contact with the waiter but he was constantly on his phone. This happened multiple times, throughout the evening. At the end of the meal while trying to order desert there was about 10min that went by where we couldn‚Äôt see a waiter anywhere. Shame that the service ruined this dinner for us."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Had a fantastic experience at Fortnum & Mason Royal Exchange! The ambiance was elegant, the food exquisite, and the service outstanding. A special thanks to Petras and Romi for their warm hospitality and great recommendations. Looking forward to returning!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"First time I visited and I would definitely recommend.  It was such a lovely experience, first class service and food.  I had bacon and tomato with sourdough toast and it was all well presented, fresh and beautifully cooked.  It certainly lived up to its reputation.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful and we did not feel rushed. I would certainly visit again."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,Food very good and the service was good. Would thoroughly recommend. Brilliant.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,the best selections on the set menu have an additional cost e.g. limited choice if you have a voucher.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,We enjoyed the most amazing breakfast here. The service was great and the setting is beautiful.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"If you like awesome service with a friendly smile good quality menu a most go place if you like English tea, surround by a historical building but keep in mind that all this comes at a price it should be a treat unless you have money to go there every day"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,What a nice surrounding with great food and service.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"We used a Virginia Experience voucher, lovely venue with beautiful shops and architecture all around the glass roof courtyard.
The fixed menu was varied and the food really tasty.
We were treated as valued guests, not rushed, had a great time."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"We popped in here whilst it was tipping down outside.  We often visit the shop but wanted to try the champers and oysters at the bar! Unfortunately the manager here has a dreadful inferiority complex which means he feels he has to be rude and superior to assert his authority.  The staff were all grumpy and have no hospitality training whatsoever, no service, no smile, no how was your experience, the chap that gave us the bill could barely grunt at us. Very disappointing given that the staff in the shop are excellent and make the shopping experience there extra special, especially the lady from New Zealand who is fabulous and obviously loves her job."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,A wonderful place to visit for a special treat for afternoon tea. The service was impeccable and the afternoon tea was very generous for the price.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Fortum's shop in the Royal Exchange is an absolute gem in the neighborhood. You have a great selection of teas, biscuits, honey and jam. Tea tasting is available every day. The interaction with the staff is friendly and fun. Love going there for a little break!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,One of my go to places in London for Welsh rarebit which is getting harder and harder to find these days. During times of Covid I actually feel comfortable eating here even though it‚Äôs indoors because the building is so large that you can actually feel air currents moving around
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,Overall a great experience. We used the Virgin Experience package for a special night out. The building is amazing and the general atmosphere is pretty good. Only complaint is it said cocktail and we clearly just got bubbles. Would have been cool to get a nice cocktail to add to the experience.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,Lovely venue but service was very poor. The manager is not welcoming. Claims it‚Äôs only a place for dinner and don‚Äôt serve coffee or tea at 4pm. It‚Äôs a convenient place to meet up but after one experience I won‚Äôt recommend it.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Amazing location,  friendly staff and high quality food."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"One of the blond female reception staff was so rude! She was shouted to some customers said ""Go to the bar not here!!"". Where is your manner seriously?
It‚Äôs a shame that such a beautiful location doesn‚Äôt have nice service. I seriously think that they better need to change the staff."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,3.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful place to sit for a drink especially with all of the Christmas decorations, however when we had a drink here we did seem to be invisible to the staff when it came to ordering... it does have a bit of a snobby vibe, not sure I‚Äôd bother returning, I think there‚Äôs better places around with much better service for a similar kind of price."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"This is a special place to eat (if it's not cold outside) fab setting. Food was good, although I didn't agree with adding items with a surcharge to the voucher experience menu. Sides are expensive for what they are - new potatoes ¬£6.50. But overall worth going to"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,Great iconic place. Food OK but expected more for that price.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,"Perfect food and perfect service, was a lovely experience and felt very welcomed"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,3.0,Great food and atmosphere. Service left more to be desired with regards to how long they took to serve us & politeness. In condolence we were offered a free round of champagne
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"Came here with one of my friends. we used  the virgin experience voucher. Menu was very limited and most dishes required us to pay extra.
Table service was ok but I felt they were rushing us and kept bringing the next course before we had even finished the first. They just wanted us out as soon as possible.
The cocktails were very unpleasant and neither of us drunk them. We weren‚Äôt even asked or given an option about which cocktail we would like.  The waiter just brought the cocktails to the table and they tasted more like undiluted blueberry squash.
Wouldn‚Äôt come back in a rush if at all.
Starters were delicious but they replaced the trout for salmon hoping we didn‚Äôt notice that. Main dish was ok nothing amazing and the cake was pretty average too."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,2.0,"I remember the good old days when customer service was a Fortnum & Mason priority - oh, how times have changed!

I told the server I was here for coffee and business meeting - I was seated at 11am.  At 11:15 I was asked to order food or move!  Really?  I queried why and was told ""you are not eating""  Duh!  I told you I was not from the outset.

I was moved to the bar and subsequently charged 12.5% service charge for the privilege!  Yet another shady practice.

Come on F&M - sort it out!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,A lovely experience. Staff were great. Food and drink was lovely. Definitely recommend
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,We had a lovely meal as a gift from our youngest son for my birthday. Beautiful surroundings and the food was very good. Our Hungarian server Robbie was excellent. Very attentive and full of knowledge about the Royal Exchange. Recommend
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,3.0,"If service is anything to go by, it was mediocre at best. Food was good, and the ambiance was tremendous! We had two different waiter (I think there was a change in shift). Both competed in being rude and unwelcoming. Is that a part of the trademark? Is it what makes them special? Was it because I was a tourist? Anyway being from Dubai, I was not impressed and was happy to leave as soon as possible and have lunch elsewhere. Even my guests, who work in the City looked a bit embarrassed.  Not again!"
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,4.0,"Cool location at the Royal Exchange, like the teas and coffee of Fortnum's but service at the bar where I was made to sit lacked friendly service with a smile. I only ordered a latte but would have anticipated a glass of water and a napkin, neither were supplied and the bill arrived with no smile and  service charge.

Hopefully, basic hospitality training will fix these slight problems."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,1.0,"Very disappointed. I made a reservation for lunch and then called to see if we could just come in for tea service. I was told absolutely and that a reservation wasn‚Äôt needed and we could just come in. I therefore canceled the lunch reservation. When we arrived we were informed that you could only have tea service with a reservation and that drinks and a bar menu were available at the bar. On a first come first served basis.  When we explained the situation and what we had been told we then had a manager explain their whole policy to us. While we confirmed we now understood their policy, we repeated what we had been told on the phone and remembered the name of who we spoke to. The manager kept repeating their policy and reservation procedure which of course was not what we had been told on the phone. No apology or accommodation was given and we were made to feel that we must had been confused and made the error. Poor customer service."
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,5.0,Lovely experience as always. Live music came on about 7/8pm on the Tuesday we were there.
The Fortnum‚Äôs Bar & Restaurant at Royal Exchange,2.0,"I honestly think that if you're paying c.¬£70 for 2 glasses of champagne each that maybe the service could be, you know, nice and polite?  We weren't even provided a napkin, certainly no nuts and the service from the barman was surly, disinterested and with zero proactivity. I noticed his attitude changed when he was talking to an attractive female.  Naturally they add a 12.5% service charge, which I nearly asked to be removed, but thought it easier to just pay and leave.
The champagne (F&M Blanc to Blanc) wasn't particularly outstanding either.
I think we'll spend our money elsewhere in future."
Circolo Popolare,,Óóä
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Circolo Popolare is such a stunning place ‚Äî the interior alone makes it worth visiting, with its warm, lively atmosphere and beautiful design.

The food was simply delicious, full of flavor and clearly made with care. Everything felt fresh and authentic, making the whole dining experience even more special.

The staff were welcoming and attentive, even with how busy it gets. Overall, it‚Äôs a must-visit spot in Paris if you‚Äôre looking for great food in an unforgettable setting."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"When you see a restaurant with 30k reviews at 4.8 you really good into it expecting a lot. Unfortunately for us it was just overrated?
The setting of the restaurant is beautiful. Really eclectic and super fun to look around. Its busy but can talk comfortably and the cocktails and drinks looked excellent. As far as our experience of getting some pasta and tiramisu, it had much to be desired.
I didnt think the service was exceptional considering the optional 12.5% tip and the pasta was bland. High quality ingredients, but just very 'English' in flavour profile and lacked any complicated depth i would expect.
It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't amazing for the London price."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"I was visiting London for tourism with my boyfriend and came across Circolo Popolare on social media and it looked beautiful, so we decided to try it for my birthday lunch, and I‚Äôm so glad we did! The space is absolutely stunning, the food was amazing with great portion sizes, and the service truly made the experience special. Every staff member was so kind, they kept wishing me a happy birthday, and the servers even gave me a card and sang happy birthday to me! It was such a sweet and personal touch. This place made my birthday feel extra special. Highly recommend for a memorable meal in London!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,Such a beautiful place and the food was amazing. The truffle pasta and the tiramisu were delicious. The chicken Milanese was alright. Great service and there was no waiting time as if you came in with no booking they can seat you at the sharing table. Maria at the reception was very friendly.
Circolo Popolare,5.0,Wonderful recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. Very popular even on a Thursday afternoon and queue stared forming well before the doors open at noon. Excellent service. But the table was too tiny for the size of the plates. The fish was yummy. The pizza is good but the best of the best was the heavenly tiramisu. To die for!
Circolo Popolare,5.0,I‚Äôm a fan of Big Mama. Circolo Popolare one of my favourite Italian restaurants in London. Amazing & stunning decoration.Drink & Food was perfect.I really love pasta. Services was good and all staffs very friendly. Reasonable price and good atmosphere. Highly recommend.
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"We had a wonderful experience ü§© The pastas were perfectly cooked and full of flavor, and the pizza was just as impressive, fresh ingredients and a delicious crust. Everything tasted authentic and comforting. A lovely place for anyone craving true Italian food"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"The place is super nicely decorated great for a date. Unfortunately our waiter was not the best that day he actually went to the terrace to sleep and then no one was attending our table. Food was good I recommend the fried cheese and the fresh mozzarella, we missed to order the carbonara pasta that looked amazing! You need to order the lemon pie for dessert It was really really good!"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"The restaurant was wonderfully decorated, quite a big area full of vibrance totally giving the sicilian ambience. The staff were attentive and helpful especially Rohit, their service was perfect. We ordered the blue cheese ravioli ( super yum) and the aubergine milanese- which was quite perfect for me. My spouse ordered the chicken with lemon and crispy potatoes- the potatoes were seasoned also the vege but the chicken were underwhelmingly bland ( should have ordered something else). We ordered profiteroles ( crunchy, well balanced and perfect), the tiramisu lacks the richness in taste."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Such a great atmosphere and food to suit! All the staff were so friendly and welcoming, so happy to be there. They sang Happy Birthday to all the birthday bookings too! The truffle pasta was amazing absolutely the best in London ‚ò∫Ô∏è pizza was amazing and drinks are great! Fantastic aesthetics too for the restaurant with high ceilings and loads of green plants."
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"The ambience at Circolo Popolare is undeniably cool. The decor is stunning, the atmosphere is buzzing, and it feels like a special place to be. This, combined with their truffle pasta ‚Äì which is genuinely spectacular and a 5-star dish on its own ‚Äì should be a recipe for success.

Unfortunately, beyond that single pasta dish, the food was consistently disappointing. The ""warm"" focaccia was obviously microwaved, with cold spots and an uneven texture (albeit, it was still very tasty). On the other hand, the ""Some Like it Hot"" pizza was a misnomer; it lacked any spice or flavour, and was strangely sweet.

Our waiter was attentive and friendly, and we genuinely appreciated their service. However, the experience was soured at the end when they explicitly asked us to leave a positive review and mention them by name. We were planning to praise their service anyway, but the direct request made the interaction feel transactional and a bit disingenuous, as if the good service was performed solely for a public mention.

This feeling was compounded by the frustrating payment process. We were pushed to use an app which charged a non-optional 13.5% (not the usual 12.5%) ""discretionary"" tip (you have to awkwardly ask staff to change it) and an additional ""platform fee."" It's baffling to be charged extra for a system that replaces a simple, personal interaction.

While the vibe and the truffle pasta are major draws, they aren't enough to make up for inconsistent food and an experience that ultimately feels more focused on image and upselling than genuine hospitality."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Food was great and unique, really good service. Very popular destination for photos so please do make your reservations in advance, it‚Äôs essential.
(There is a 12.5% compulsory service fee applied)"
Circolo Popolare,2.0,"Lunch for my mum‚Äôs birthday was very disappointing.
The restaurant looked lovely and staff were friendly.
Unfortunately the food looked pretty but was very disappointing. We ordered 5 meals and they were lukewarm at best and lacked flavour.
We spent ¬£191, left more food than we ate and had to go to another restaurant after because we all left hungry."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"The reviews are accurate. It‚Äôs great food and an amazing space
Weirdly never been here before‚Ä¶ but glad we went (purely on the basis of the Google reviews)
The foods was delicious. Particularly the starters.
But more than anything it was the atmosphere that separates this restaurant from its competitors
Make sure you book early  - because the restaurant gets extremely busy"
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"Very beautiful place, food was okay, however service was not great, my wife booked a table and told them it's my husband birthday, no cake, no Ice cream, when requested, so end up leaving, soon mains was served. Food was great but service was shit.... I heard alot good reviews but shame when I went nothing!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre transported into a dreamy Italian escape. The vibe is electric lush decor, twinkling lights, and walls lined with bottles give it such a cozy yet vibrant atmosphere. The food? Incredible. Every dish is bursting with flavor and so beautifully presented, the truffle pasta was absolute standout.

The staff is super friendly and attentive, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. It‚Äôs one of those places you just can‚Äôt stop thinking about. I‚Äôm honestly obsessed, can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,Great food and great ambiance. We had the truffle pizza and crab pasta. Our two year old enjoyed the butter pasta. They brought truffle pasta instead of the pizza by mistake but then still offered that to us free of cost. The pizza was one of the beat we have had in our life. The dough literally melted in the mouth. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for good Italian food
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"A perfect place, perfect pizzas, pastas and all food and drinks. The environment is very well designed, the lighting and service are super. The staff is very professional and they give you informative explanations about the food. A perfect place, a must visit on every London trip."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Ambience and decor is a 10/10 for this restaurant. Absolutely charming and super cosy at the same time!

Reservations are necessary especially for dinner as they are mostly booked out, and that makes walk-ins nearly impossible. Lucked out when I tried to walk-in for a lunch on a weekday.

Food was good (burrata was fresh, pasta cooked al dente), well prepared but not mind-blowing. I guess I had very high expectations from the high 4.8 star Google rating and after reading the reviews.

Service crew were attentive and super friendly. I enjoyed my time dining at Circolo, and will come back if I‚Äôm around the area."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Circolo Popolare is a total vibe! The ambiance is absolutely stunning‚Äîevery corner feels like a celebration. The food? Delicious from start to finish, full of bold, fresh flavours. Perfect spot for a memorable night out with friends or a special date. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful cosy Italian in central London. Lovely authentic Italian menu and some nice cocktail options. The food was amazing, best Pizza I've ever had! Never seen a thinner crust. Staff was super friendly. We were there with a one year old and they were extremely accommodating with the buggy and high chair and also everyone was entertaining the baby : ) rare to find such a lovely place with actual friendly staff in London, so all the 5 star reviews are completely justified."
Circolo Popolare,1.0,"I came to this restaurant with high expectations, but unfortunately left very disappointed. The portions are extremely small for the price ‚Äì after my main dish I was still hungry. On top of that, the service could use serious improvement: my food was served on a chipped plate, which is unacceptable for a place that tries to appear upscale. The worst part, however, was my drink ‚Äì it came with a fly in it. The staff didn‚Äôt handle the situation professionally; they just replaced the glass without even offering an apology.
Overall: I cannot recommend this restaurant. For these prices, you can easily find places nearby where the food is both satisfying and served under proper hygienic conditions"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Freshly made, good food.
Great wine and cocktail selections. Unfortunately, the Staff was experiencing an 'off' night?
Honestly,  it felt touristy and a more authentic Italian experience could be had elsewhere."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Circolo Popolare is a feast for the senses ‚Äî the atmosphere is vibrant, the decor is stunning, and the food is simply unforgettable. Every dish was bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The staff were incredibly friendly and made us feel so welcome. A must-visit gem in London!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Tonight, my family and I went to Circolo Popolare restaurant.
The table they had chosen for us was in a cozy corner of the second section of the Restaurant‚Äîa peaceful and comfortable spot.
We started with Sangiovese wine, which was Absolutely Rich and Splendid.
For starters, we ordered PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA, STRACCHINO FRITTO, and ASPARAGUS SALAD. The salad was amazing.
For the main course, we had SPIEDINO DI POLLO AL LIMONE, LA GRAN CARBONARA, BURRATA AL PESTO DI BASILICO, and DANCING QUEEN‚Äîall of them were incredibly tasty.
Now, about the atmosphere and vibe‚Äîthe moment we stepped in, it felt so inviting! It truly felt like stepping into Italy.The d√©cor was beautiful and vintage, adding to the charm of the place.
Our waiter, Stephanie, was absolutely delightful, warm, and friendly. She took great care of our table and made sure everything was perfect.
Overall, everything was amazing! We had a fantastic time and will definitely be coming back!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"We had booked this place weeks in advance knowing it would be difficult to find a spot otherwise, and it was absolutely worth the effort. Circolo Popolare‚Äôs atmosphere is bold, lively, and theatrical‚Äîwalls stacked floor-to-ceiling with thousands of bottles, ceilings draped with string lights and greenery, and a warm golden glow that makes the space feel festive and inviting. The vibe is buzzing and playful, more like a big Italian family gathering than a quiet dinner, with friendly service that keeps pace despite the energy. It‚Äôs an immersive setting that‚Äôs as much about the spectacle as the food, making it one of the most visually memorable dining experiences in London.

The food was top notch from start to finish. For starters, we had the fried mozzarella, carpaccio, and focaccia with bruschetta. All were excellent, but the bruschetta stood out for its twist on the classic‚Äîit was topped with grilled red and yellow peppers, which added a smoky sweetness and worked beautifully. I‚Äôd recommend all of them. For mains, we went with the classic Margherita pizza, the truffle pasta, and the crab spaghetti. The pizza had a light, Neapolitan-style dough‚Äîslightly soggy in the middle but redeemed by its airy, charred crust that gave it character. The crab spaghetti was flavorful and a strong option for seafood lovers, while the truffle pasta was easily the star of the night. It‚Äôs one of their signature dishes for good reason: creamy sauce, perfectly cooked pasta, and a luxurious flavor combination that made it an easy 10/10.

Overall, if you‚Äôre in the mood for a contemporary Italian dinner with a vibrant, festive atmosphere and food that delivers on quality, this place is a must-visit in London."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"The food was good, atmosphere excellent, just be prepared for sharing tables. Service was a little inattentive. Venue is very pretty."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Excellent food. Good service. Festive atmosphere. This place is huge but gets booked up quickly. The food, taste, quality and portions are really good!
The steak was just right. Pizza was tasty. Ravioli was good.

The price is suitable and equitable. We had to use our phones to access the menu. I do hope they have physical menus to ensure it is accessible to all. Whilst I didn't like that I had to use my phone to access the menu, I guess it helps remove additional clutter. But I think people should readily have the option. Or at least one paper menu per table.
For some reason there were no point glasses or something. But the menu for drinks were using that measurement. We were told instead of a pint that we can do two halves and we had to ensure that we paid for a pint rather than the charged us for 2 half pints as that wasn't a fault of ours.
Whilst the food was on point, I really went  to try the lemon meringue pie. I was too full by the time it arrived but it was really good. It was so over the top, in a hood way. We clearly over ordered on desserts...ah well.
The one main thing I didn't like was the hidden charge in paying the bill via the QR code and having the customer pay to use their platform. That is less of a service and we are paying more for that. Again, it wasn't our choice to use the platform, so do not enforce a charge on us.
Overall, worthwhile... as the food is good quality. But careful on the subtleties of some unnecessary charges."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"This was my second time in Circolo and it was a wonderful experience yet again. Brought in with me my sister and friends, it was their first time. Excellent food and cocktails, top-notch service and very professional staff. Shoutout to Eijaz who was serving our table, very helpful and accommodating. He made my mum's birthday celebration even more special with complimentary Tiramisu and Limoncello shots. We all had a great time. Thank you for the experience. Highly recommend, will visit again :)"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"We can here in 15th April for a bug dinner to celebrate our wedding day! We had a table of 17!!! And our server was amazing!!! Angel was our server and they were amazing!! Angel was so accommodating and kind! Angel is a credit to the restaurant and went well out their way to give us the most amazing wedding dinner!

The food was amazing! Everyone was happy and full by the end of the evening! I could not recommend this place enough! ü©∑"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"The place was very busy, the service was excellent. Feels very homely and professional at the same time. Lovely decor and music to create the vibes. Lemon meringue pie was very tangy lemon on the base and a very light Creamy meringue mousse. Ragu dish was meaty and not too heavy. Recommend the foccacia and parma ham."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,Everything was perfect and delicious!! Our server Roby went above and beyond to make our dinner special. She gave us the best recommendations for drink and dinner. I‚Äôve never had better service! Even the managers stopped by to check on us to make sure we were enjoying our experience. Every single person from the hosts to the bartenders were so friendly. I‚Äôm traveling from the US but will make sure to come back again!
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Lovely place 3min. walk from TottCourt Road station. The decor is truly amazing, nice athmosphere, good service and quality food. This was our 2nd time visit; this time we had a lunch on Friday afternoon, it was busy so reservation is needed. We ordered some antipasti then pasta & pizza main course (pasta with fresh truffle was really tasty) and dessert (tiramisu - top score plus some icecream)."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Beautiful restaurant with really tasty fluffy-crust pizzas and fun mocktails. I like that the menu has calorie content listed, as well.
The pastas tasted a little plain for the money, but there were plenty of choices and it was worth trying."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Came for my birthday and although we were late they were incredibly accommodating! The service was excellent and loved their touches like the signed card and dessert with candle!
Bathrooms are clean  and the food was well seasoned and tasty. We had the truffle pasta. Music is kind of loud so you struggle to talk at a normal volume. Would recommend."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"We had a fantastic time at Circolo Popolare. The restaurant was really busy (no surprise given how popular it is!) but it didn‚Äôt affect the service at all ‚Äî everything was smooth, friendly, and efficient.

The food was absolutely gorgeous. Every dish was full of flavour, but the standout for us was the lemon meringue pie ‚Äî not only delicious, but massive! Definitely one to share (or not!).

The atmosphere was lively with great vibes all round. A brilliant spot if you‚Äôre after authentic Italian food in a fun, buzzing setting."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"This is one of those destination restaurants within London for birthdays and celebrations, or just to have a great meal within a beautifully decorated space.

Our waiters who took our orders were lovely and the welcoming, also food was great, however some of the food runners and other staff could have had better attitudes.

This place offers the experience of pasta by your table, it‚Äôs a great selling point and one that draws the influencers in who promote it on socials.

We are not that type but we wanted a video and picture by our table nonetheless, we were met with less that enthusiastic responses that left us feeling ashamed in some way for even asking.

They are no doubt sick of people asking for photos and what not, but that‚Äôs part of the job.

Could not fault the food and it was indeed vary tasty, drinks were top notch and made perfectly.

We will be back and I would highly recommend this restaurant."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"We had an amazing experience. Everything was perfect, from the service to the food. Our waiter Felix made our time in the restaurant even better. I highly recommend, and will be coming back for sure!!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Took my mum here for a Mother‚Äôs Day treat and it did not disappoint. Truly a memorable experience, great food (very big portions!!), fantastic decor, and superb drinks. My mum said her fish was so good it melted in the mouth. Will definitely be back :)"
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"Although it is extremely popular and needs to be booked weeks in advance, this restaurant did not leave a perfect impression. The food is tasty but not the best, although compared to other London restaurants, it is excellent. The pizza is average, as is the pasta. The chicken with potatoes was great, but the portion could have been bigger.
The best thing was the tiramisu‚Äîhighly recommended!

A downside is the digital menu, which is difficult to navigate. Additionally, payment can be made online without calling the waiter, but a 13.5% tip is automatically added, which can be an unpleasant surprise for guests. On top of that, there is an extra charge for using the digital payment service, but with a note that this fee can be avoided if a waiter is called. However, when we called the waiter, he directed us back to digital payment, putting the guest in an awkward position."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"You NEED a reservation, its always so busy. Food was great, service was good too. You can tell they are constantly busy but food came fast. I do feel like it was a little over prices for what is was, it ended up being one of the more expensive meals we had on our trip but definitely not the best. Still great though!! Just be prepared to spend a lot. Not a huge fan of the desserts but the pistachio sorbet was good."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"1. Good place to celebrate birthday or anniversary. The staffs will give you a card with their signatures! So warm! Ofc birthday song!
2. Buonissimo!! The food is great! Above average! Love the ravioli and the truffle pasta!!
3. The decoration is very beautiful too! Full of wine bottles, plates and photos!
4. Easy to pay!!! Spilt or pay together by phone(Apple Pay)

Come with friends or family!! Better not come alone, otherwise you will feel lonely:)"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Had a lovely dinner here with a group of friends. We were lucky to get a table without a reservation, but I‚Äôd definitely recommend booking ahead‚Äîyou won‚Äôt want to miss out on the wonderful food. Our server, F√©lix, was fantastic: knowledgeable, friendly, and made the whole experience even better."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Don't believe the negative feedback until you truly experience it yourself.
Top restaurant ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Pros:
1. Excellent staff service. Luis was so friendly and warm. Everyone made our experience magical.
2. Food is better than in Italy when I went.
3. Clean and immaculate place.
4. Food is affordable, I was expecting it to be pricier.
5. Magical, Instagrammable worthy restaurant.
6. Loved the Carbonara, Truffle pizza and Tiramisu is the best in the country. Hands down. Wow!
7. Accessible through tube travel.
Cons:
1. Open style toilet by the sink for male and female that they have to dim the lights so down low. My sister slipped.
2. Could have a bigger sign outside the restaurant.
They gave me a birthday card and free tiramisu that was enough for 3x people for free. They sang to me ü•∞ thanks for the wonderful staff who work here. Highly recommended! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Had a family meal for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and it was excellent, from beginning to end. Our waiter, Felix, was the perfect host, the food was incredible (my foodie son declared the carbonara the best he‚Äôd ever tasted) and the atmosphere brilliant- we were near the pass - felt like we were in an episode of The Bear! Just loved it and would highly recommend"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"My girlfriend and I are huge fans of Italian cuisine, so we had high expectations‚Äîand this place completely exceeded them! The atmosphere was beautiful, and the food was easily some of the best Italian we‚Äôve ever had. We started with the prosciutto and focaccia (not pictured), which were both incredible. The focaccia was soft and tender, and the prosciutto tasted fresh and authentically Italian. I ordered the grilled steak with salsa verde and a side of potatoes (also not pictured), and everything was full of flavor and perfectly cooked.
The real standout, though, was the ravioli‚Äîit was hands down the best we‚Äôve ever had. Every bite was rich, flavorful, and unforgettable. The drinks were also excellent, rounding out an amazing meal. We‚Äôre already planning our next visit!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Really enjoyed celebrating my friend‚Äôs birthday here! The service was good and the food was really nice too! The pasta was flavourful and cooked perfectly. We were worried that the food won‚Äôt be as good as it is a social media famous please but we were pleasantly surprised.
We couldn‚Äôt resist ordering another portion of the carbonara because it came with the cheese wheel.
Would come here again for a special occasion!"
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"Food is good!! Tiramisu just melt in my mouth‚Ä¶ but still felt heavy.

It‚Äôs so busy so I went in the afternoon. Still the waiters seem to be stressed out because it‚Äôs too busy, and not enough waiters to take care of everyone‚Ä¶ hard to catch their attention. I asked for tab water 2 times and it only came after I finished all my food and dessert. I was so thirsty and I had to pour from the table next to me who had their tab water‚Ä¶ in the end when I pay there was no paper of details, they just type a number on the card machine."
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"The food overall was nice, however, we ordered an arrabbiata (which wasn‚Äôt listed on the menu). What arrived was simply spaghetti in a plain tomato sauce‚Äîcompletely bland and lacking any seasoning‚Äîso we returned it.

Service left a lot to be desired. We struggled to get the waiter‚Äôs attention both when ordering dessert and again when asking for the bill. At one point, we were abruptly told there would be no dessert menu and that we had to use the QR code instead, before the staff member briskly walked away. It left us feeling as though we weren‚Äôt worth their time.

The venue and atmosphere is lovely."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Managed to snag a weekday reservation with a few friends. One of the most gorgeous restaurant interiors I‚Äôve ever been in. Beautifully ordained ceilings with fairly lights engrossed in green vines and of course the iconic walls decorated with thousands of drink bottles. The restaurant is also much larger than images would lead to believe and our table was actually at the far back in a wide open area and we had a glimpse of a very lovely looking outdoor seating area as well. The tableware is all very lovely too but we noticed many were a bit chipped or slightly dirty upon arrival.

This is the second of the Big Mamma restaurants I have visited (the other being Gloria) and is definitely an improvement. From the sides we had their focaccia, deep-fried stracchino, courgette salad, beef leg carpaccio, and beef tartare. Everything tasted great with the beef tartare and deep-fried stracchino sticks being standouts. The beef leg carpaccio was good but had a slight fruitiness which I‚Äôm not too sure if is to my taste. Based on experience I would go for some of their other cured meat options but their beef tartare is a must.

From the mains we had the truffle pasta which I had at Gloria as well. This does not come with a wheel of cheese at Circolo (that is now reserved for their carbonara) but means you can order a single portion. Whilst somewhat bland at Gloria, here it was a delight and was a favourite among my group. We also had their veal ragu pasta which was excellent and might have been favourite pasta I‚Äôve had yet from Big Mamma. We also had their chicken skewers which came with crispy smashed potatoes and aubergine. This was good and came with decent variety. From the veggie options we had the spring fling pizza and the crispy breaded aubergine. The latter was fantastic and an excellent vegan option. The pizza however was not to my taste at all since it was adorned with many of their house olives which are quite strong. However, other members of my group did enjoy it so only order if you are sure to like their olives.

Lastly, from dessert we had their strawberry tomato salad and their profiterole. Both were great and the strawberry salad was a nice fresh finish to the meal. I would say that their lemon meringue pie is still probably the best dessert along with their cheesecake (which was unfortunately not available here).

Service was good, sometimes a bit muddled when taking additional orders and at one point gave us sparkling instead of tap water. Quite nice overall though. Overall, would definitely recommend trying if you can get a reservation but wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs worth booking months in advance unless you want a real showstopping experience for friends and family."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Absolutely stunning place, decoration is so immersive. Food was delicious, very well served dessert portions!
The cocktails were very good too!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,We had a pre-theatre lunch here and it was incredible! The staff are so friendly and attentive. Even those who weren‚Äôt looking after us would give a smile. The food is so tasty and you get a great portion size. Highly recommend the asparagus antipasti! We will be back :)
Circolo Popolare,5.0,Delicious food and great service. Place is a bit overcrowded and you need to book in advance. But it‚Äôs worth it. Strongly recommend.
Circolo Popolare,5.0,We had we had a great evening! The dishes we had was most perfect and also favorite delicious. The pizza was one of the best I ever had the tomato sauce on that pizza was just amazing. We also very much liked all all the dishes. We will recommend everybody to come back to this place.
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Amazing food, especially La Gran Carbonara (takes a bit long to make but definitely worth the wait). The restaurant‚Äôs decoration is from another world. Great experience!!!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"the pizza was soo good. the crust was chewy but not overly thick, and the slight spiciness from the olives was calmed down by the cold burrata on top. the coldness of the burrata also juxtaposed with the hot crust, which was just an amazing flavour explosion.

the stracciatella was also a 10/10 - no surprise becsuse burrata is always delicious and this one was very fresh. the focaccia was good but wasn't toasted and didn't feel super fresh but was still delicious. the beef didn't have an overwhelmingly strong or raw taste, which made it a nice experience to eat.

however, the pastas were more mediocre for me. my friends claimed that the noodles were not soggy or weirdly sticky and chewy but i thought otherwise. the sauce for both pastas
were good though - very rich and flavourful"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"The food is alright, did not blow us away but was still tasty. The pasta was a bit hard, almost like it was undercooked rather than just al dente. However, the lemon tart was incredible - definitely recommend that! But all in all, it‚Äôs a really lovely restaurant / atmosphere and the staff were extremely friendly. We felt so comfortable dining here and didn‚Äôt feel rushed by the staff at all."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"This restaurant is absolutely beautiful inside. elegant, romantic, and perfect for couples. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the prices were very reasonable. The focaccia was a tad too salty for my taste, but everything else was spot on. I‚Äôd definitely return and highly recommend it for a special evening out."
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"I found this restaurant on google as highly recommended. I showed up for lunch without a reservation and was able to eat 50 min later. Reserve ahead üôÇ

My server was slow to come and slow to deliver my drink but was friendly. My server was also slow to take my order. This is not necessarily a critique if you want to take your time üôÇ

I wanted the carbonara but was by myself so my server and I discussed some other options before she announced they could do carbonara for one üíô

I am sorry to say that my carbonara was very oversalted. It was edible but nothing special

I then put out my credit card to pay and was informed I could see my bill using the QR code. They add a tip and you have to ask your serve to remove it.

I‚Äôve increasingly noticed European restaurants following this American trend despite paying far better wages built into the prices

I did think the prices were reasonable

So that‚Äôs my opinion of this very popular place"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Good food, we shared the famous lemon meringue pie (was very hot outside so think it melted!) and had the truffle pizza with tomato salad. Nice atomosphere would come again!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Hello.  Circolo Popolare was an incredible experience for us.  The greatest spot to have delicious Italian meals as a single person, couple, or group.  We ordered some testy cocktails and enjoyed a great pasta dish and a rocket pizza. The venue was really elegant, the personnel was quite pleasant, and the service was excellent.  In ten minutes, I received my order.  The employee that took our orders was Angel.  He gave a thorough explanation of everything.  He was fantastic.  He was especially helpful in selecting the food and beverages, both of which were excellent.  I would like to mention that the birthday celebration was unforgettable.  Although it was my first time, it won't be my last.  Many thanks"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Everything about this place is just fantastic. Food is delicious on another level, beautifully served + great selection of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Botanical decor makes you feel like you are sitting in an Italian tavern. Good customer service, you feel welcomed and looked after from the entry. Will be back for more!"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Stunning Interior, Mediocre Food

We visited Circolo Popolare mainly for its gorgeous, chic interior ‚Äì and it definitely delivered on atmosphere and design. The place is visually stunning and has a great vibe.

Unfortunately, the food didn‚Äôt quite match the setting. The truffle pasta was overcooked and overly buttery ‚Äì the truffle flavor was lost under all that richness. The meat was undercooked, which was disappointing.

On the bright side, the staff acknowledged the kitchen issues and offered us extra champagne, which was a nice gesture.

Overall, it was a mediocre experience ‚Äì beautiful setting, but the food needs to live up to the hype."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Had a nice meal. I'm not a huge fan of shared tables, but it worked out they accommodated us anyway, If that's not for you .. make a reservation!
!*** update***, All the food tasted quite good and was quick to the table,
We had the Carpaccio, foccacia, and pizza."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Such a beautifully designed restaurant with great atmosphere and service. The food was good, but for the look, cost of it and difficulty getting a reservation I did expect more. There was no stand out dish to for me."
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Great restaurant and the service from all the staff was very good. Ambience is lovely and wasn‚Äôt overly loud and could comfortably have a conversation with a partner/friends.

One thing I would have liked as a standard thing, is to have physical food menus rather than scanning a code to access it. Would be nice to have this without having to ask for it. The wine and drinks list came as a physical menu, but this was not the case for the food menu.

Overall a nice restaurant and would recommend to use again in the future."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Lovely place to come for food. Came with my friends for two of their birthdays. The staff were very attentive and even gave my friends birthday cards! We all agreed our starters were quite bland, however our mains were fantastic! I had the Tagliatella All‚ÄôOssobuco, which had a lovely ragu sauce with tons of flavour and depth. The prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and the service. An amazing place I would definitely recommend‚ù§Ô∏è"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Not sure where to start, but I will say that everything was just perfect. I booked a table for myself and my mum for Mother‚Äôs Day and we had some of the antipasti, the carbonara that came served in the Parmesan wheel and of course a pizza (one of the best pizza tasted) because we like food and we ended with one lemon pie to share. We both loved the experience, the food and the service. Highly recommend and we will be back. ü•≥"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"The restaurant is beautiful!! The cocktail was tasty and refreshing , the pizza is ok, the carb pasta was delicious and the desserts were really yummy."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"I‚Äôve tried several dishes at Circolo Popolare. Not all their pasta is to my taste‚ÄîI'm not a fan of the Crab Pasta, but I really enjoyed the Ravioli alla Bolognese. Their Truffle Pizza is definitely a must-try! The ambiance is really nice and lively, making it a great place to dine. As for the tiramisu, it‚Äôs just okay for me, but of course, it depends on your personal taste. Overall, worth a visit with some dishes worth trying!"
Circolo Popolare,2.0,"Not worth the hype.

Lovely ambiance but a dated ‚Äòchain feeling‚Äô restaurant.
Some of the food we had for the standard of restaurant was sub-par, burnt bread and chicken on the pinker side. The pasta dishes were gorgeous and perfectly cooked (crab).

Most of the crockery was beautiful looking but a lot of it had chips and dents.

We were told to pay via the QR code app which automatically submits service charge and then asks for additional tip on top of previous service charge and then adds an admin fee per transaction on top!

Overall nice causal restaurant but not a special experience."
Circolo Popolare,1.0,Food wasn‚Äôt amazing. Ordered carbonara for 2 ppl in round pecorino cheese. The sauce stayed inside the cheese and has been taken away therefore pasta was dry and also hard (not even al dente). I mean hard. Also literally had 3 pieces of meat inside for each person. Coctails were small and expensive. The tiramisu was also small portion. The only thing we liked was the lemon tart. We won‚Äôt be back for sure.
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Lovely place. Great food - loved the truffle pizza, Burrata, and the small plates we ordered. Stunning interiors from the walls decorated with vintage bottles, ceiling decor etc. Staff were cordial, and service was super quick. We had a lovely time. I‚Äôm kicking myself that I was too full to try any of their desserts. Would highly recommend!"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,Lovely Italian restaurant with an amazing atmosphere. Circolo Popolare has a large menu for all types of eaters. The carpaccio was just perfect and went well with the focaccia. Also their pasta dishes are delicious. It's a bit pricey but would definitely recommend it. Don't forget to make a reservation.
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"The food was amazingly delicious and a very good service. I will recommend it. Also, it would be good to include more vegan options for the mains with protein, normally it is just one for primo and one for secondo. The vegan dessert was superb."
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Circolo Popolare is a must-visit for all foodies around the world. First and foremost, the restaurant is a gem in terms of design‚Äîone of the most beautiful places I've been to; I can't imagine anything surpassing it in this regard.

Regarding the food, we ordered several pasta dishes, meat with vegetables, and truffle pizza, which was my favorite dish. At the restaurants in the Big Mamma group, you simply can't go wrong with pizza. The desserts and cocktails were good, but not incredible; the price was a bit high considering their taste.

On the downside, you might be unlucky enough to be seated at a cramped table, perhaps too close to other people; this wasn't our case, but we noticed it with other patrons. Additionally, you might feel a bit rushed; the food arrives very quickly, and all the waiters are very well-trained, but you're always aware that you should hurry‚Äîyou can't linger, which prevents you from having a perfect experience. However, this is understandable given the place's popularity. Reservations are mandatory, probably made at least two weeks in advance to ensure you get a spot on your desired day.

I will definitely return to this gorgeous restaurant when I visit London again."
Circolo Popolare,3.0,"It is such a beautiful restaurant, every single bottle of alcohol you can imagine all around. It has such a lovely atmosphere. The staff are really friendly.

How would I rate the food? We went with the ‚ÄòSome like it Hot‚Äô and ‚ÄòMargarita‚Äô pizza and a side of Siracchino Fritto. The pizza was a classic Italian pizza fire oven, with a thick crust and thin base. The spicy pizza I went for had so many nice flavours. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the tarragon herb on top which was a new one I hadn‚Äôt tried before. It has a licorice taste to it. Personally I don‚Äôt think this worked with the sweet and spicy flavours. I picked this off and it was a very enjoyable pizza. From pizzas I‚Äôve had and how this compares, I felt that the pizza was quite watery in the centre. The fried cheese we had on the side were cooked perfectly but didn‚Äôt have much flavour. The tomato sauce helped save the taste adding more of a rich, salty taste to it.

I think overall Circolo Popolare is a fantastic place to visit if your ever in London, for the experience. Not so much for the food. The food is great and it‚Äôs not terrible but it‚Äôs not up there with anything incredible. Overall I would rate it a 7/10. üçï"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"The food was delicious, the atmosphere absolutely stunning, and our server was excellent ‚Äî truly a memorable dining experience overall. I would have given 5 stars, but two things held me back. First, one staff member saw me waving for attention, made eye contact, then turned away without acknowledgment simply because she wasn‚Äôt in charge of our section. A small gesture like a nod or smile would have gone a long way. Then, as I was leaving, a waitress accidentally spilled drinks on me and a few other patrons. Mistakes happen, of course ‚Äî but an apology would‚Äôve been appreciated. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
Circolo Popolare,5.0,"Everything was great, and the location is amazing. We had to wait a bit for the main course, but it was worth it! I‚Äôll definitely come back! Highly recommended!"
Circolo Popolare,4.0,"Food was lovely, service too. We didn‚Äôt like the fact that one of the waiters was collecting all dirty napkins next to us, this should have been done in settings where customers shouldn‚Äôt see this."
HIDE,,Óóä
HIDE,4.0,"The food was excellent ‚Äî fresh flavors, beautifully balanced, and presented with a clean, refined aesthetic. Each dish reflected great attention to detail in execution.

Unfortunately, the service fell short of the same standard. While the plates spoke for themselves, the experience was let down when our waiter began walking away midway through explaining a dish. It disrupted the flow and diminished what should have been a polished, engaging moment.

Overall, the cooking deserves recognition, but service consistency needs to match the quality coming out of the kitchen for the experience to truly shine."
HIDE,4.0,"We celebrated an anniversary at Hide, and were lucky enough to have received a gift voucher to use for dinner. We decided on the tasting menu which was divine. The service was mostly fantastic, and we enjoyed the special experience as a whole.

We weren‚Äôt given a wine list to ascertain prices or review what we might like to drink. We were basically just asked what we like, and could‚Äôve been given ¬£¬£¬£ wines by the glass. I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with this and it felt like a fuss to ask for the menu.

The music was not a vibe and I often found it too loud. It was like classic hits and pop songs rather than an ambient, elegant restaurant playlist which I feel would be better.

The signature dessert let the entire menu down. It‚Äôs beautiful being modelled on the staircase, but the dominant banana flavour I really didn‚Äôt enjoy, and I didn‚Äôt finish it.

Overall, we did love the dinner but there were a few details that let some parts down."
HIDE,3.0,"Difficult to assess. We were told initially we were going to be upstairs, but we were sat downstairs. Very busy venue with lots of groups some quieter than others. We went for breakfast and I am a huge fan of cooked breakfasts. The ‚Äúfry up‚Äù was a very small mushroom, one unexciting sausage of no great flavour and two small rashers of streaky bacon and half a large tomato with a thick central core. The food was reasonably free of too much grease, but not overly flavoursome, sadly a nice but underwhelming breakfast, not least for the price. At ¬£30 one expects great textured flavour rich sausages. Eggs were just ages nicely cooked but not much more to say. Staff were lovely breakfast was ok. My sourdough toast was good and my daughter was thrilled with her huge croissant with a number of choices of spreads and jams. Is it interesting? Yes, was it the sort of meal I would expect to see at a one Michelin starred venue not really"
HIDE,5.0,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and had the tasting menu which was wonderful.
I wanted to especially mention our server Chloe - she was incredible. She made our evening so special and she took special care with the dietary requirements as I was pregnant. She really is a credit to this restaurant.
Chloe - if you‚Äôre reading this, you were right - we had a girl! :)"
HIDE,5.0,"‚≠êÔ∏è5 stars ‚Äì One of London‚Äôs finest, consistently exceptional.

Took my best friend here for a treat and had the tasting menu, absolutely incredible. Every dish was refined, refreshing, and packed with thoughtful flavours. It‚Äôs the kind of food you simply can‚Äôt replicate at home, which makes the experience feel special.

The portions were just right: satisfying without being overwhelming. Service was polished, friendly, and perfectly paced. You leave feeling well looked after, not overly full or rushed.

This spot has been holding the bar high for years and still delivers every single time. A true favourite. 10/10."
HIDE,5.0,"The unusual menu format drew me to Hide but I found the whole experience surpassed my expectations and was far better than the foamy fare of standard Michelin Star places. The rotation of charming service staff with each dish was a nice touch to sync in with the variety of the courses. Our favorite course was the Not A Bread but it was one of many stand outs. Ambience, design and music also all excellent. Wine pairing was mixed and didn't stand out. Would benefit from more unusual offerings complimenting the menu style."
HIDE,4.0,"It was still a wonderful dining experience but felt a little different this time due to the recent change of chef and menu. Service is good - warm and professional, and nothing is overlooked from start to end. The updated menu is quite intriguing. A couple of dishes stand out, strong getting wowed of the truffle tart. Even so, we were sad to not see some hits from the previous repeats and overall flavour profile felt a bit less bold. It is still one of the finest dinning places in the surrounding area. Eager to see how the new chef will take the culinary directions further."
HIDE,5.0,"I‚Äôll save you time- book reservations here now. Hands down the best breakfast experience I‚Äôve ever had. I especially loved the small menu of rare and fine coffees, which were all absolutely delicious with unexpected flavors. The porridge, granola, black truffle, scrambled eggs, and croque monsieur were all absolutely exceptional. To top everything off, the sleek and organic design aesthetic adds to your experience as well as the great customer service. I highly recommend and hope I can return soon!"
HIDE,3.0,"My friend and I had the tasting menu. Food was nice. The first few snacks were amazing in terms of variety and presentation, but it went downhill as we moved to the fish and lamb courses. They were still nice but not memorable, really. The restaurant was so dark at that point that we almost had to blind test our taste buds, the experience which I didn't enjoy as much. Colour vibrancy was essential to me, especially at over ¬£200 price point without alcoholic consumption. Service was lacking. The sever didn't place cutlery gently or with precision. The restaurant didn't give me a fine dining setting anyway. Explanation of the dishes was not clear, and adding on top of the lack of visual presentation in the dark, I could hardly tell which was which. The oak staircase was great. The water tank-like glass facade facing the buzz of the city was controversial at ground level though."
HIDE,5.0,"Tucked away from central London‚Äôs chaos, this must-visit spot offers a truly memorable dining experience. The serene, picturesque setting and unique aesthetics transport you far from the city the moment you arrive.

Service is top-tier; warm, thoughtful, and attentive. During a special occasion, the staff quietly offered a better table when one opened up, making the time there even more special.

The curated menu balances creativity with comfort, with each dish feeling purposeful and refined.

Perfect for celebrations or quiet escapes, this restaurant is a rare find, charming, calming, and unforgettable."
HIDE,4.0,"The service? Outstanding! The interior design? Amazing.
The food was also very good, but I have to say, the buckwheat dish (and that's the only dish I can give an opinion on) was a tad bit too acidic. Instead of raw onions, caramelised ones would give a bit of sweetness and a bit crisp, I suppose. Great quality nevertheless, and the service was amazing, very kind people. In general, more on the expensive side, but the interior design alone is worth paying a visit. Very earthy.
The tea was also very good (could be a bit stronger, though (French Blue)."
HIDE,4.0,"Service was outstanding. Immaculately presented food. The flavour profile of the dishes left me wanting, just a little bit; not quite as balanced as I would have hoped for, considering the price. Outstanding in catering for dietary requirements."
HIDE,5.0,"We booked a breakfast reservation at Hide, and it exceeded all our expectations! This one Michelin star restaurant offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but the breakfast alone is worth the visit. We were seated promptly, and the ambiance was elegant with a unique woody and quirky charm. Don‚Äôt miss the stunning spiral staircase‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for a photo op. They offer a great selection of specialty coffees and beans; my iced coffee was excellent. The standout for me was the granola yogurt‚Äîit was absolutely fantastic. Highly recommend this spot for a refined and memorable breakfast experience!"
HIDE,5.0,"Nice breakfast experience. A bit on the pricy side but you pay for the place and location. Brioche bread on the toast and scrambled eggs a bit dry, but nothing a good spoon of butter can‚Äôt fix."
HIDE,4.0,"Nice venue, good service. My main course was a rabbit lasagna (¬£8 supplement and not really worth it as it was very small for what you get).

Americano charged at ¬£6.50 and you don‚Äôt even get a small biscuit or chocolate- a rip off for a coffee.

Compared to other restaurants, I found the venue on the overprice side  for what you get."
HIDE,5.0,Breakfast at Hide during the Pride parade - booked it via a phone call as there was no more availability for the time we wanted online - window seat to watch the parade - Magic.  Everything we ordered was seriously good.  The seasonal Danish was AMAZING. Strawberry and tonka bean - who knew?
HIDE,4.0,"I had a really nice lunch at HIDE the other day. The lunch menu is pretty well priced and comes with a starter, main, and dessert. The oyster tempura was definitely my favourite. The dessert is not as good as the mains unfortunately.

The service however could have been better - the staff were a bit cold, and it didn‚Äôt really have the attentiveness you‚Äôd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant."
HIDE,4.0,"Had a lovely dinner at Hide, invited by a business partner. The food was creative and tasty with a very cohesive menu. The service was friendly, and our glasses were always full. The cocktail prices are quite reasonable, I'd be gladly back to have their tasting menu. Highlights for me were the amazing breads and the mushroom broth!"
HIDE,5.0,"I had an unforgettable lunch experience at Hide. From the moment I walked in, the service was impeccable ‚Äî warm, professional, and perfectly in line with Michelin standards. The lunch set menu was beautifully curated, offering refined flavors, artistic presentation, and thoughtful balance in every course. The ambiance was elegant yet relaxed, allowing me to fully enjoy each dish in comfort. Every detail, from the freshly baked bread to the final petit fours, reflected a high level of care and craftsmanship. I highly recommend Hide for anyone looking for an exceptional fine dining experience in London."
HIDE,5.0,"My first birthday celebration in London with a beautiful soul who is really thoughtful. It was a bit surprise for me as I just mentioned the name of the restaurant randomly.‚ô•Ô∏è

Thank you so much for the wonderful experience. I enjoyed the dishes we ordered and the special cards with the little candle ~ it was such a joyful moment.

I am not a wine drinker but I quite enjoyed drinking the red wine here üç∑ and it didn‚Äôt make my face red at all.

‚Ä¢ Ambiance: 5/5
‚Ä¢ Service: 5/5 ‚Äî attentive without being pushy
‚Ä¢ Food: 5/5 ‚Äî full of rich, flavorful taste
‚Ä¢ Company: 6/5

Highly recommend for a ‚≠êÔ∏è star-level dining experience or celebrating special events!"
HIDE,4.0,"Really striking restaurant- light and airy and the seating was incredibly comfortable
We were there for Sunday lunch - each course was well made and tasty - everyone enjoyed their dishes.
The stand out was the rabbit lasagne - would come back for they alone.
The desserts which are typically my favourite course were too sweet and rich with no relief or something to cut through the sugar
Would def come back to have dinner
The only let down for us was the service - unfortunately our waitress was not the nicest coming across as quite curt - asking for anything eg the drinks menu etc seemed to be a hassle for her which dampened our experience"
HIDE,4.0,"Little disappointed from this over hyped restaurant.

The setting is beautiful, the staircase is a showstopper, staff are welcoming and professional.

Attention to detail is lacking, my water glass smelled like egg (it was replaced, but should not have been at the table), sugar bowl was chipped and for a restaurant of this calibre should not have been placed at the table.

Croque monsieur was delicious but the crust was hard to cut or bite into.

The Florentine eggs were very slightly undercooked as you had the gelatinous white. The spinach was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.

For the famous banana and pecan croissant and French toast, what a disappointment.
Both lacked in taste, very soggy and uninteresting.

This was not my first nor will it be  my last time the place is beautiful, staff are lovely and I'm sure there is plenty of other dishes to try."
HIDE,5.0,"Breakfast here was such a vibe. We had the Full English, truffle scrambled eggs on toast, egg Benedict and blueberry toast. I highly recommend the blueberry toast, however the only thing that wasn‚Äôt to my taste was the Thai coffee. Being Thai myself I should‚Äôve known! Really looking forward to my next visit here."
HIDE,5.0,"Exceptional food, beautiful decor, fantastic ambience and perfect service.
Having visited a few times now I have never had a bad experience at Hide.
There is something for everyone on the menu and no dish will disappoint you, particular highlights being the softshell crab, bread basket (absolute must) and the potato cakes. All of the steaks are high quality meat cooked to perfection.
The staff are plentiful and extremely attentive but without feeling overbearing. They're always there when you need them but unlike some establishments they aren't constantly interrupting you. The sommelier team and the selection of wines behind them are the icing on the cake to the brilliant food.
From full meals, to snacks to drinks in the bar downstairs you will never be disappointed here."
HIDE,5.0,"This place was beyond my expectations. Appart from the amazing service, the food was delicious. Everything, from the bread at the start to the desert at the end was perfect. I enjoyed every moment of it. Now the place itself ‚Ä¶ simply gorgeous. The stair is actually made from one single tree. When you go there, visit the private rooms downstairs (if they are empty). Each one of them is decorated with a theme. I would recommended a hundreds times !!!"
HIDE,5.0,"The service was exceptional, the ambiance was beautiful, and the atmosphere was just perfect. The food? Absolutely unforgettable - the best breakfast I‚Äôve ever had! Whatever you do, don‚Äôt skip the soaked pistachio orange bun, it was pure perfection. Words can‚Äôt truly capture how amazing this experience was, so just go and see for yourself!"
HIDE,4.0,"We had a nice breakfast experience here overall. The free cloakroom was a nice touch as we entered. The restaurant itself is beautiful; yes, the stairs are pretty cool. The service was quite friendly and we were served fairly quickly. The croque monsieur was tasty, though the coffee was not particularly memorable, certainly not for the price."
HIDE,5.0,"Two young kids (3, 5) and a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant often isn‚Äôt a good idea. It was the best experience at HIDE! We were all made to feel so welcome. Phenomenal food. The ‚Äúiconic‚Äù pairing was great. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more! Thank-you HIDE for an epic, memorable experience üôè"
HIDE,5.0,"Hide was definitely one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever eaten at in London! This was my fifth time visiting, and I usually spend a week dining out. I‚Äôm happy to say that Hide is in my top three!

The atmosphere is fantastic, the service is excellent, and the food was absolutely on point! We also tried a vintage dessert wine, which was just perfect.

We loved it so much that we recommended it to our friends, and they loved it too!"
HIDE,3.0,"Amazing front of house team. Amazing energy and warming team. Good mushroom, black pudding and sausage. Sour dough bread was super hard, tomato needs seasoning and flavour like the mushroom. Egg where cold and so was the pate"
HIDE,5.0,I visited Hide during December and to this day I still think of it often as their interior to their food was so memorable. Starting from the beautiful open inside that spirals up a mystical feeling tree carved stair case. The Croque Madame was incredible and their Nova Lox wrap was a very creative take on meal that I have myself often at home. Service here was great and drinks were also delicious.
HIDE,5.0,Just keep coming back! Food and Service outstanding and not to mention the wine list. Especially Sanita went above and beyond to share the secrets of the staircase. Will definitely be booking to come back soon.
HIDE,5.0,"Hide is just fantastic! The atmosphere is great and it is just a very good place to enjoy high quality food! From the pastries, to the sweets and savory tu dishes! Really enjoyed the experience!"
HIDE,5.0,Great spot for brunch for a special occasion - they gave me a card and a candle on my pastry for my birthday. Loved the truffle scramble eggs on toast and we also had the buckwheat pancake waffle with smoked salmon (less memorable). The pain au chocolate was also lovely though and the staff were super attentive and willing to go the extra mile to take photos for us. Coffee was also great and good selection of beans.
HIDE,5.0,Fantastic breakfast. The fresh sweet mango is prepared particularly special. We also had the avocado and poached eggs and fresh juices. The centre piece of the restaurant is the spiral hand carved staircase and the front door is also amazing in that it‚Äôs almost ‚Äúhidden‚Äù
HIDE,4.0,"We visited for breakfast, the pastries and croque Madame were really good. Unfortunately found the brioche for the truffle scrambled egg quite dry.
Service was great and was nice atmosphere."
HIDE,4.0,"Celebrated my birthday here last week. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. We got the bread basket (highly recommend), the nest egg (10/10), beetroot starter (7/10), scallops (8/10), mains were venison (7/10) and octopus (8/10), with a pear sorbet (9/10).

It was a great experience and the service was excellent! The decor is beautiful as well, we will be back to experience the breakfast:)"
HIDE,4.0,"I‚Äôve been here twice for breakfast/brunch. I wouldn‚Äôt say the food is amazing, but it‚Äôs really, really good. It‚Äôs a little pricey, but since it‚Äôs a fancy place, that‚Äôs expected. The ambiance is super stylish‚ÄîI especially like their area on the upper floor. My a√ßa√≠ bowl was just okay, but the matcha was really good, and the pastries were excellent."
HIDE,5.0,"Great meal out last night in the UK.  Order two bread baskets, one goes quick.  Food and service were outstanding.  Great night out."
HIDE,5.0,Been here twice for brunch. Once solo and one with friends for my birthday. Each time I received impeccable friendly service. The breakfast and pastries were both divine. Such a pretty restaurant too.
HIDE,1.0,"Lovely restaurant, swift service and great presentation. The price you pay, the portions you receive not worth it at all. Food was very average at best. Menu description was great and really oversold very average food.

Was not impressed with the way they portrayed the choice of waiters/waitresses for food service. They had chosen a few certain ethnic backgrounds which isn't an issue but the way they were serving was as if they had been told to act a certain way. Reminded me of slaves. Really not impressed."
HIDE,5.0,Great food. Egg royale is very recommended. The service was great and waited maximum 5 minutes until I got my order. Should note that the prices are high.
HIDE,5.0,"Loved the meal here! Serves were knowledgable, super friendly and they gave us a tour of the wine cellar too! Great evening out"
HIDE,4.0,"What a lovely experience.
We got a table that overlooked Green Park which was a lovely sight.
The food was good, perhaps slightly underwhelming for a one star restaurant.
Service was on point, the sommelier was very friendly and knowledgeable.
We didn‚Äôt feel rushed and enjoy every single minute of our experience.
For a treat, go and try Hide. You overall won‚Äôt be disappointed"
HIDE,1.0,"This restaurant has been our favourite for years, we always recommended it to friends and visitors. But the last visit was a waste of money, sadly. We couldn‚Äôt understand the change but later learnt that Ollie is no longer the chef there üíî he would have never put raw unseasoned cucumbers at the top like that. Smaller portions and thin flavour. I understand the loyalty to promote your other staff but won‚Äôt be surprised if you lose your star next year. The desserts were great but it‚Äôs just one course from 4 we tried. Gutted to lose this place ü•∫"
HIDE,5.0,"Is the staircase amazing? Yes
Is the service good? Yes
Is the food excellent? Yes
Is the view nice? Yes

But, I've had better pastries elsewhere in London for way cheaper (it cost me ¬£72 for 2 drinks and 3 dishes of food.)

It's definitely an experience and somewhere to have a celebration, but I don't think we'd ever come back on a whim."
HIDE,5.0,"Had an intimate wedding dinner in a private room (reading room). Thoughtful and whimsical decor. The staff was exceptional! Not only in knowledge of what they were doing, also very personal and authentic. THATS what you need in a great service team! Food was excellent as well, as expected from a Michelin Restaurant, but the service was what makes you feel at home. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"
HIDE,5.0,"Very happy with the set lunch (though still pricey, nett ¬£64).
Lamb tartare starter - excellent, prata bread and greens complemented perfectly.
Steamed cod - excellent, flavourful mussel broth, perfectly cooked fish to the ideal texture, and a satisfying portion size
Lava tart and oak ice cream - average. Ice cream was quite melted (maybe the bowl wasn‚Äôt pre-chilled)"
HIDE,4.0,"We have lovely breakfast.  We like it esp the French Toast.
Both decoration and ambience is very nice."
HIDE,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants in London. I‚Äôve been at least 8 times and the breakfast and lunch are both equally amazing, alongside the service and ambience. The bar downstairs is also great with wonderful negronis. The bread basket is the best bread basket I‚Äôve ever had."
HIDE,3.0,"Food was outstanding, but our service and experience was disappointing. I think we got unlucky with our waiter, we were left waiting 30 minutes to order our food and he got my main order wrong. He was very uncommunicative and didn‚Äôt double check our order at all. We were visiting for breakfast and got very hungry. I noticed people around us had a stall for their bags, but we weren‚Äôt given this. I was expecting a lot better from a Michelin star restaurant. We were visiting for a special occasion (anniversary) and did not feel like it was as much of a treat as it should have been."
HIDE,4.0,"Our first time here, ordered croque madame with truffle. It was pretty nice. Enjoyed much."
HIDE,5.0,Lovely restaurant with pleasant staff. Price commentate to location and decor. Food was good.
HIDE,1.0,"I was genuinely excited to have breakfast at HIDE, but left disappointed. I ordered the ‚ÄúRipe honey mango with Thai basil & kaffir lime‚Äù the description sounded refined and thoughtful. In reality, it was just two plain mango slices with a few micro herbs on top. No noticeable kaffir lime, no complexity, no special touch. Just mango. It felt more like a garnish than a standalone dish

Also, many dishes are not available for takeaway ‚Äúdue to sauces or presentation,‚Äù which makes it unnecessarily restrictive especially when the food is quite simple

A beautiful place, but the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations"
HIDE,3.0,"Style over substance. The bread is it's high and it goes down from there. Had the tasting menu which is hors d'oeuvre 3 courses and petit fours. For ¬£165 not good value! The food whilst cooked well was unimaginative and I wasn't wowed by the flavour. The lamb dish was a toughish piece of meat and the fat not rendered down.

Any easy pass"
HIDE,3.0,"I had high expectations for the food considering the Michelin star and the rave reviews online by influencers. Unfortunately, I thought that the food was lacklustre considering the price point and what the restaurant sets out to achieve.

Firstly, the French toast was decent but not amazing. The insides were more mushy than soft, hence there was a lack of bite to the dish.

Secondly, the croissants I ordered - chocolate and pecan banana were served cold, and I think they would have tasted better if they were warm. There was hardly any chocolate in the chocolate croissant at all.

Oysters were okay if on the small side.

Service was decent but restaurant was really busy on the day I went so staff was unable to interact much with guests.

Overall, would expect better for the price point of the restaurant."
HIDE,4.0,"Was there a few weeks ago to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday, and it was a great dining experience. The service was attentive, friendly, and thoughtful, making the occasion feel extra special.

The food was was beautifully presented. Some of the dishes that I enjoyed were so unique as well like the scallops specifically. The restraunt‚Äôs ambiance made this a memorable experience."
HIDE,5.0,"Staff were friendly and attentive, food and drinks were effortless, quick to arrive and very tasty for breakfast. The speciality coffee was amazing, have never tasted such a smooth coffee in my life. Price point was fair for quality and service. Can‚Äôt wait to come back, maybe for dinner next time."
HIDE,5.0,Fine dining done right! The food was great overall but the buckwheat pancake with salmon and cream cheese was the star of the show üåü
HIDE,4.0,"Great experience all round. Good food, excellent service and relaxed but still nice environment.
Stand-out menu item was the French toast. The banana pecan croissant was not everything it was hyped to be. Everything else was great."
HIDE,5.0,"It was an amazing celebration of my birthday in such a beautiful, cozy atmosphere of the highest quality restaurant in the heart of central London. Thank you so much for that evening üòä.  Everything was perfect üëå."
HIDE,5.0,We had an amazing anniversary dinner. Special mention to our server SINITA not sure of the spelling. But she really did a great job explaining the dishes to us. Our favorite is the carabineros prawns it was superb highly recommended. ü•∞
HIDE,4.0,"During my recent visit to The Hide, I found the food to be decent but not particularly remarkable. Among the dishes we tried, the egg nest and grilled octopus stood out as the better options, showcasing some creativity and flavor. However, the overall dining experience was marred by service issues.

It was a busy night at the restaurant, which undoubtedly contributed to the challenges we faced in getting attention from our server. We often found ourselves needing to flag down someone just to refill our water or wine glasses, which is frustrating during a celebratory girls' night out in London.

When our main courses arrived, there was a notable mix-up with the orders. The server seemed confused about which dish belonged to whom, which is quite unacceptable, especially in a busy restaurant setting. This added a layer of stress to the evening that detracted from our enjoyment.

Ultimately, the lack of timely refills for our drinks significantly impacted our experience. It‚Äôs disappointing when a night out is overshadowed by service shortcomings, despite the potential for a good meal. I hope The Hide can address these issues, as the food has promise, but the service needs improvement to match."
HIDE,5.0,"Visited HIDE for breakfast and I would say it has to be one of the most opulent breakfast experiences I've had!

The venue is truly stunning and ascending the iconic staircase to my table really set the scene for the experience.

I ordered the Full English with poached eggs and a Flat White. Both were excellent, every element of the breakfast plate was meticulously prepared and presented. The bread and butter were incredibly good and the eggs were poached to perfection. The coffee was also excellent, I chose an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee however there are a variety of coffees to choose from.

Service was relaxed and attentive without being overbearing.

It's not every day one gets the chance to have a Michelin-starred breakfast. It's a very enjoyable experience and one I would recommend!"
HIDE,2.0,"Ngl I feel like Ive just been scammed. Ridiculous price for such a bad experience, the starter was the first but not the last disappointment, I was expected to experience the journey of Italian cuisine, not an Asian parent‚Äôs simulator, the starter what was the name? Meat n Bones? Just a small piece of bacon wrapped around a bone like stick no taste no flavor just purely for show. It‚Äôs like you(an Asian) were presented with your firstborn child and you don‚Äôt know what to do with the child so you tried to give the kid every chances in life only for it to end up as a mixture of fancy useless failure. The rest of the dishes were the same as the first, bunches of f disappointment. The attitude of one of the waitress was not very polite, we were talking when the waitresses bring out the dishes and started coughing or something, trying to stop us from talking so she can introduce the dish(it happened many times not just once), very unprofessional, is what normal people would say but for me, she is a spoiled brat who were definitely raised by a bad single parent(clearly she did not know how to behave in such environment) because what she was doing not only damaged her reputation but the restaurant too, she must know that actions have consequences, I normally would leave a 15% tips but for her action I regret that I can not take the tips from her. (personally Im asian and where Im from, attitudes, especially in the service‚Äôs industry is everything, the key to success or their downfall). Last but not least, the atmosphere was in fact the most pleasant thing out of everything I had just mentioned above. The wooden stair was alright but still nothing impressive like Bacchanalia. For conclusion, save your money for other high-end restaurants, this one does not worth the hype nor the price. I only choose to go to this one on valentine because others are fully booked. Just for the final nail in the coffin, anyone know the differences between jokes and food from HIDE? Jokes have meanings. I am being generous to give it a 2 stars rating, it deserves 0,5."
HIDE,4.0,"Visited HIDE before Christmas for lunch.

Overall we found this place lived upto our expectations, with great front of house staff, lovely atmosphere and stunning surroundings.

The food was expectational but even for regulars to Michelin star restaurants, we found it very expensive."
HIDE,1.0,"Very bland fish with two pieces of a vegetable, 3 mussels and of course a foamy sauce. Pretty tasteless, not worth the hype. The waiter kept coming to talk to us which was irritating, called us ""his lovely ladies"" üôÑ Also we took tap water but they put still water on our bill and almost charged us."
HIDE,5.0,"From the moment I walked in, the space felt elegant but still super inviting, with all the natural light coming through those huge glass windows. Walking up the iconic staircase to my table really set the vibe for something special. The service was on point; really friendly and attentive but not over the top. For the quality of food and the whole experience, I‚Äôd say it was well worth it. If you‚Äôre looking for a fancy but relaxed breakfast spot in London, this is it. Whether you‚Äôre into Michelin-starred dining or just want to treat yourself, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving it a try!"
HIDE,5.0,"To me, one of the best restaurants in London for all occasions. Service is exceptional. Ambience, food servicing, selection of spirits, it all gives you a unique experience.
My personal top choice is breakfast for sure, definitely go for French toast, and try any pastry (these are freshly baked every morning)
Dinner is also worth mentioning. Every dish is a masterpiece. From starters, I really enjoyed scallops and mackerel tartar.
As for the main, my go-to is octopus (it just melts)"
HIDE,4.0,"Service and location make this place worth a visit.  Sit on the 1st floor with a view of Green Park.    The Mango dish was yummy, but very small.    Croque Monsieur hit the mark."
HIDE,5.0,"Hands down best breakfast place in London. Obsessed with their food. Come here every couple of weeks to check out new pastries on the menu- always innovative! It is pricey, but as expected in Mayfair. Service not always on point (they seem to have a lot of rotation), but that‚Äôs just a detail and the food is worth it! Nice coffee selection with some interesting choices. Try it!"
HIDE,5.0,"One of the best dining experiences I've had, not just in London, but in all of the places I've ever travelled to. I was down with work and brought along my partner - and we both LOVED the food and hospitality was next level. Can't recommend this place enough to anyone that loves dining at the next level."
HIDE,5.0,"I unfortunately was not looking at the menu prices properly or it's just I didn't think that my starter which I chose XL size prawns wouldn't cost me a 90¬£ , but I was wrong and I actually didn't really enjoy them as of I payed 90¬£ ,but didn't had any satisfaction from having it. Glad it isn't me the one who payed our bill :)))"
HIDE,5.0,"This was our first time in a Michelin starred restaurant, and thus at HIDE. Everything was perfect, from service to food. Everyone was very welcoming, waiters gave us awesome food recommendations! For the quality of the food we tasted, this felt perfectly priced. This is hands on the best restaurant I‚Äôve been to.
I‚Äôd recommend trying the chicken liver parfait, and the chocolate pot, both were wow."
HIDE,5.0,"It was an amazing evening at HIDE. The team was so hospitable and delivered from the moment we stepped into the restaurant till the end.

From introducing the menu to giving recommendations, we were easily convinced by the knowledgeable staff.

Food in general was really presentable, we were a little underwhelmed by the highly acclaimed appetiser - nest egg. It was solid but it didn‚Äôt deliver the wow factor we were expecting. However, the meticulous craftsmanship dedicated to creating the dish and the egg itself was appreciated.

The mains were just gorgeous, we ordered chicken, pork and squid. They were all very delicious and cooked to perfection, we didn‚Äôt leave anything behind. We also really loved how the meat dishes were prepared in more than one ways, so you can get variations out of the dishes. It was a lovely bonus! We order some sides and they were all solid.

The highlight of the evening had got to be the acorn cake, we ordered one each and we all thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of the searing and bubbling cake, which was a well made brioche soaked in syrup, caramel and alcohol. It was dense, but it was divine.

The only hiccup that evening was the server of our table had been mixing up the sparkling and still water preferences for guests, at one point he even mixed different water into our glasses."
HIDE,4.0,"Went to HIDE to try their breakfast, which I‚Äôve heard is the best in London. Was it? Not really, but it was good overall.
Staff was great, even when they forgot our hot drinks order they were very apologetic.
Pastries were absolutely incredible, if this is something you have to try there, it‚Äôs that. Also, please try them all. Hats off to the pastry chef there.
When it comes to savoury food, this is where it gets a bit‚Ä¶ different. Hollandaise was very vinegary, eggs on the croque madame was overcooked, my buckwheat waffle pancake was lacking flavour, and overall it was all very fat.
Will I go back? Not for breakfast for sure."
HIDE,1.0,"Food is perfect. But my friends and I will never come to this restaurant again because I was discriminated against by the Asian waitress in your restaurant!!
There was an Asian waitress with long hair and white shirt. She had a very terrible attitude to me. When I walked in, she saw me but didn't talk to me and stand at the front desk Ôºàlike a sculpture as she doesn‚Äôt move at allÔºâwaited for me to come in and ask , like my boss. She didn't help me to save my coat and spoke in a very soft voice so I can‚Äôt hear her voice clearly.ÔºàI thought she was sickÔºâ. She also was very impatient when I asked her to repeatÔºàwith extremely mean tone and she always rolled her eyes at me!! ÔºâAnd she didn't lead me the way!! Why do other customers have waiters to guide them, but I don‚Äôt? I walk to downstairs alone to wait for a table. However, I saw that she smiled at other customers and had a very good attitude. She also took their coats, except me. So I suspect she discriminates against me. It needs to be emphasized that we were here to celebrated a birthday üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
The food in the restaurant was delicious and  other waiters were very nice. Except this Asian waitress. Please fire her. If she continues to treat Asians like this, your restaurant will soon lose all Asian customers.

Reminder‚ö†Ô∏è: If you are Asian customer please don't let this Asian waitress serve you because she doesn't seem to like our race."
HIDE,3.0,"Th√© service was averagely good. From the moment we entered, they took our coats and hanged them with them.
We were then seated and whilst they took time to take our order; they later were fairly better as they noticed us more and gave us our dishes, changed our plates and handed us the cheques.
We ordered three dishes for breakfast:
Avocado toast: delicious. Loved the blend of flavours and the citrus flavour. A bit difficult to cut through
French toast: delicious and soft; easy to cut through. The blueberry and the cr√®me were superb. Loved the freshness of them
Pain au chocolat: soft and a bit crunchy. The chocolate was fine. I wouldn‚Äôt order it again though.

The atmosphere was lovely. Loved the decoration. Clean toilets."
HIDE,4.0,"Great quality ingredients, the prawns with flat bread were a real highlight.

Very nice use of local leafy greens with interesting textures and flavour profiles."
HIDE,5.0,"Hide has been an iconic establishment in the London food scene for a few years now and has a Michelin star. I have been here for breakfast and meals for a few times and the place never fails and has always had an amazing service and food. It‚Äôs got a great wine and champagne selection to suit all wallets. My only suggestion is that the menu is same for so long that I have been through the entire menu over the last few visits. It needs some refreshing and new features.
Breakfast is still amazing and has the best croissants and coffees in town.
Verdict is 5/5
Budget meal for two is easily ¬£200 with couple of glasses of simple basic wines. Of course goes up with cocktails and bottles of wine."

Tattu London,5.0,"To make our overseas friend‚Äôs Birthday celebration memorable, particularly as this was their second visit to London, we selected the Tattu restaurant, which exceeded our expectations from the moment we entered through the eliminated tunnel and ascended the lift. We were warmly greeted at the lift with exceptional hospitality while proceeding  to our table.

The restaurant‚Äôs ambiance is equally impressive, featuring exquisite decor. And The live DJ playing great music in the background.

The culinary offerings were equally impressive, with each delectable dish presented artistically and bursting with incredible flavours. The service was smooth, friendly, and never rushed, the attentive waiter further contributed to the exceptional ambience of the evening.
They even brought out a surprise birthday treat for our friend. it was a lovely touch that made the evening more special.

I highly recommend dining at Tattu, a renowned restaurant celebrated for its exceptional cuisine, impeccable service, and memorable dining experience."
Tattu London,4.0,"Tattu London offers a refined and elegant dining experience. The atmosphere is chic and intimate, perfect for a special evening out. The service was impeccable ‚Äî attentive, warm, and professional from start to finish.

The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor. The duck dumplings were a standout ‚Äî rich, tender, and perfectly balanced ‚Äî definitely my favorite dish of the evening. Most of the dishes were excellent, though the salmon was slightly overcooked for my taste. Still, everything else was absolutely delicious.

I was a bit less impressed by the cocktails. Despite the restaurant‚Äôs strong reputation, I found them overpriced and not particularly well-balanced ‚Äî the alcohol was barely noticeable, which made them feel a bit flat.

One drawback worth mentioning: there was no air conditioning, and it got uncomfortably warm inside, which detracted a little from the overall experience given the summer heat.

Overall, Tattu is a wonderful place for a stylish night out, with fantastic food, a lovely ambiance, and top-tier service ‚Äî just a few details that could be improved."
Tattu London,4.0,"Service was excellent from start to finish with everyone from the hostess to our waiter. We were initially given a set menu with very limited options, but the staff were very accommodating and kindly provided us with the larger dinner menu for more choice.

The food itself was good, but unfortunately wasn‚Äôt great value for money. Portions were quite small and a bit underwhelming in taste, though beautifully presented and definitely picture worthy.

The atmosphere was lovely, especially in the evening when the lighting and ambience really elevated the experience. One small downside is that they don‚Äôt allow cakes or desserts from outside, which can be inconvenient for celebrations (but expected for fine dining)."
Tattu London,5.0,"Loved the experience. We booked a reservation for 2 people, a week in advance and received a warm welcome on our arrival. We were served by Ahmed, who was very helpful in selecting our course of food. We received an impeccable service with great food (even with vegetarian meals). It was a great experience. Would definitely recommend and we will be visiting again as well."
Tattu London,3.0,"Great service and really lovely interiors and views of the city, but I‚Äôd say quite overpriced. The food was good but not good enough to get me back a second time around. I feel like the flavour combinations could be a bit more creative.

My husband and I came for our anniversary and had two starters, the honey pork (best of the dishes we tried) as a main, and the pear sticky toffee pudding for dessert."
Tattu London,5.0,Absolutely incredible and delicious. Fabulous decor. The place to go in London. The beef and duck fried rice were perfect. We enjoyed many bites and full plates. I wish we had more room to eat more.
Tattu London,5.0,Delicious restaurant with unique and flavorful food. The staff was very professional and courteous. I had a meeting with two American friends hadn't seen in two years. we wanted to remember a great moment. Was pricing but the experience is worth it. We enjoyed the view of the city and the decoration.
Tattu London,5.0,"Everything about this place was/is amazing. From the walk upto the restaurant through the lit up tunnel, going up in the lift, being met at the lift exit and walking through the restaurant to your table. The views from your table are fantastic.  The service is exceptional and omg, the food is unbelievable. Probably one of the best restaurant ive been to. Planning another trip to london just i can go back here again with my husband (visited with my eldest son for an after show birthday treat, they even broughtout a treat for him for his birthday). Had the set menu (¬£36.90) fantastic value. Pre ordered the the dragon cocktails (¬£50x2, one would have been enough for 2 ppl)
Would highly recommended, they were delicious and good fun.
Thank you so much Tattu for helping our stay in London that bit more special"
Tattu London,4.0,"A fantastic spot with incredible food and a stunning atmosphere. The squid was incredibly fresh, and the salmon was perfectly cooked with a sweet tang sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection .For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was rich, warm, and served with ice cream. The views of London are breathtaking, and the decor is impeccable, making it an ideal choice for a romantic date night.

The only reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they forgot our drinks, and the service was on the slower side. That said, I‚Äôd still highly recommend it for a special evening out."
Tattu London,5.0,"Went for a late lunch birthday celebration with my wife, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was calm and relaxed, just what we were hoping for. The staff were incredibly welcoming, and our waiter, Ahmed, was absolutely fantastic. We ordered the sharing platter, and every dish was packed with flavour‚Äîtruly delicious. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Great atmosphere with live DJ music, and Morden Chinese style decorations. The restaurant is super busy, completely full, but the service is still good. The only downside is the taste of the food is not super good at the this price level."
Tattu London,5.0,"I visited Tattu last night and had an amazing dining experience. From the moment I walked in, the venue impressed me ‚Äî beautifully decorated with a stunning, ambient atmosphere that sets the perfect tone for an evening out. It‚Äôs the kind of place that makes you want to linger a little longer.

For food, I ordered the BBQ Chinese chicken, salmon, spicy noodles, and jasmine rice. Each dish was full of flavour and beautifully presented. The spicy noodles had just the right kick, and the BBQ chicken was a standout ‚Äî rich, smoky, and perfectly cooked.

Drinks were equally enjoyable. I started with a glass of Ros√©, and to my surprise, I found they served Guyanese El Dorado rum ‚Äî a rare and welcome treat. I had it with a dash of Coke, and it was the perfect finish to the meal.

Overall, the experience was fantastic. Tattu nails both style and substance, making it ideal for anything from a special dinner to a casual lunch date. I‚Äôll definitely be back ‚Äî next time, maybe for a relaxed afternoon meal."
Tattu London,5.0,"I visited this restaurant on a Thursday afternoon to celebrate receiving my university offer, and I can honestly say it was the best dining experience I‚Äôve ever had. I was seated on the 6th floor, which offered a great atmosphere and view. The staff were absolutely lovely, and the food was immaculate! The overall vibe and energy of the place were brilliant ‚Äî warm, welcoming, and full of life.

We were served by a wonderful waitress named Lin, whose service was exceptional. She was attentive, friendly, and made the whole experience even more special. Her colleagues were also fantastic ‚Äî professional, kind, and clearly passionate about what they do.

I‚Äôll definitely be coming back, and I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an unforgettable meal."
Tattu London,5.0,A really nice rooftop restaurant! We were in London for five days and managed to eat here twice! The food looks amazing and tastes really good! The staff is friendly and service minded. The price is a bit too high but we really enjoyed both our visits!
Tattu London,5.0,"Food was delicious and our waitress Melissa was super sweet, helpful and attentive. Ambiance was beautiful! I 100% recommend. The one thing is that when we went the Chili beef was out! Too bad since it‚Äôs my favourite! Thank you Tattu! ‚ô°"
Tattu London,5.0,"I finally made it to Tattu, and honestly, it lived up to the hype. From the moment I walked in, the space pulled me in, moody lighting, that cherry blossom tree centerpiece, and a vibe that feels luxe without being over the top.

The food? Beautifully done. The caramel soy beef was melt-in-your-mouth good, and the Szechuan rock shrimp had just the right kick. Every plate looked like it belonged in an art gallery, but thankfully tasted even better than it looked.

Drinks were another highlight ‚Äî I had the Skull Candy and loved how playful but well-balanced it was. Service was smooth, friendly, and never rushed ‚Äî which I appreciated.

It‚Äôs definitely a bit of a splurge, but for a night out where you want to treat yourself (or someone else), Tattu absolutely delivers. I‚Äôll be back, next time with more room for dessert."
Tattu London,5.0,"Really nice restaurant, friendly and helpful staff. The food was really good. The salmon could have a bit more flavour, but all the other dishes were amazing. I enjoyed the cocktails on the terrace before the dinner. We did have the 2 course dinner menu, and it had a good selection. We did add a couple of dishes from the A la carte to try, and we were not disappointed. Will definitely come back again."
Tattu London,5.0,"Tattu London offers an incredible dining experience The interior design is dramatic and elegant perfect for a special night out or date.

The cocktails are inventive and beautifully presented, and the desserts are both artistic and delicious. Service was professional and attentive throughout.

Expect premium prices, but the overall ambiance and attention to detail make it worth it. Highly recommend if you're looking for something upscale with a wow factor."
Tattu London,5.0,"Gorgeous and stunning venue!

I took my wife here for our anniversary and she loved every bit of the experience. From the moment you enter the venue, the ambience was perfect. The food was great as well, and our server Lin went above and beyond to make our experience 10/10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Tattu London,5.0,"GORGEOUS setting. The food was amazing and the vegan options did not disappoint. Staff were so wonderful, especially bartender who gave great recommendations for cocktail."
Tattu London,5.0,"We had a wonderful and delicious dinner at Tattu about two weeks ago and I still think about all the delicious flavors we discovered.

Denis our waiter was really nice, helpful and attentive during the whole meal and we really appreciated it! Thank you again to Denis and the whole Tattu-Team and chefs!

If we make it back to London some time, we will definitely come back to taste more delicious dishesü§©.

We recommend this restaurant without a doubt ü§ó"
Tattu London,5.0,"Had a wonderful lunch, served by Ahmed who was very attentive and gave lots of information about the menu. A beautiful setting - wonderful food, amazing drinks, can‚Äôt complain! A great central london gem and pretty good value for what it is! Lovely for a special occasion!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Had an amazing birthday celebration!
Ahmed was fantastic attentive, warm, and made the evening feel extra special. The food was outstanding, and I highly recommend trying the Emperor‚Äôs Choice menu, absolutely epic. I‚Äôd definitely go again!"
Tattu London,5.0,"I visited this restaurant for the first time to try the London location, and it was a lovely evening with my friends.

I wasn‚Äôt entirely happy with our initial seating, but Melissa went above and beyond to move us to a nicer spot. She explained the menu, gave great recommendations, and was always ready to help with any request my friends had.

Thank you so much for your kindness‚Äîwe had a fantastic night and will definitely be coming back.

The 2025 menu is outstanding. The wild mushrooms and the crispy shredded chilli beef were absolutely delicious‚Äîeasily my favourites."
Tattu London,5.0,"Went here for my friends birthday, food was amazing with even better service! Definitely recommend the set menu with the angry bird chicken. Our outstanding waitress Lin did everything to make sure we were comfortable! She also took some amazing pictures for us we would come back just for her!!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Had a really lovely evening for our wedding anniversary. From the moment we were so warmly greeted by Joanna to leaving with very full bellies as well as a doggy bag,  we were constantly smiling.
The food was utterly delicious and we were very well looked after by our server, Lin. Nothing was too much trouble and even though it was a busy Friday night it felt relaxed and chilled. It was a great anniversary dinner!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Came here for my partner‚Äôs birthday meal and was served by Ahmed, who was great at recommending cocktails and very attentive!
Most of the food was tasty, some of the dishes could have had more flavours considering the price of them.
The birthday sparklers and plate was a lovely touch that left a smile on our faces"
Tattu London,2.0,"Food was so mid. Wagyu fried rice was just‚Ä¶..no. Tiny bit of beef in a mediocre, wok hey less mixture of rice and egg ‚Äî you can get better from wok to walk. Crispy chilli beef and curry sauce tasted exactly like those you get from takeout.

Service was great, but the food seriously needs some improvement."
Tattu London,5.0,"My friend recommended Tattu as I was looking for a special place to take my client for our anniversary. I‚Äôm so glad I chose this restaurant. It truly exceeded expectations.

From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was elegant and inviting. We ordered the Tattu Special set menu, which came highly recommended, and every dish was absolutely delicious. The portions were generous, so much so that we couldn‚Äôt even finish everything. Every course from the starters to the mains and dessert was beautifully presented and packed with incredible flavours.

The service was exceptional. Zsanett who was serving us made the evening special. The staff was very friendly, attentive, and thoughtful, even going the extra mile by adding a personal wish message inside the fortune cookie and on the dessert. Such a lovely touch.

We had a table by the window on the 6th floor, offering stunning views of London, which made the experience even more memorable.

Overall, Tattu London is a must-visit for anyone looking for outstanding food, impeccable service, and a truly special dining experience. I will definitely be returning."
Tattu London,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic experience! This place is worth every penny‚Äî100%. The food is outstanding, with top-quality ingredients and generous portions. The atmosphere is a perfect 10/10, but the service goes beyond expectations‚Äî20/10! Our waitress, Asya, was exceptional and made our visit even more enjoyable. Highly recommended! They made my birthday celebration perfect."
Tattu London,5.0,"Had an amazing dining experience! The food was absolutely delicious, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The highlight of our visit was the exceptional customer service provided by Lin‚Äîso attentive, friendly, and professional. Highly recommend this place for a great meal and wonderful hospitality"
Tattu London,3.0,"Lunch set menu is good value, but nothing special. Restaurant was very quiet which is sometimes unavoidable but this means service should have been exceptional, but wasn't. Felt more cafe than stylish Restaurant as portrayed on social media. And birthday although acknowledged on entry the special desert was forgotten. When you don't drink alcohol you expect food to be top notch"
Tattu London,5.0,"I visited it once and everything was amazing.

We tried the following:

Wagyu Beef Dumpling
Lobster and Scallop Toast
Emperor‚Äôs Duck Breast
Spicy Egg Noodles
Kung Po King Prawns

Great flavors, beautifully presented dishes, a relaxing atmosphere, and excellent staff.

I would definitely choose it again.

Tattu London,5.0,"Great place!

Went for a birthday celebration and had a lovely time. The food was excellent and the decor and atmosphere was great.

It was busy and the service was hard to get their attention at times, but it was good when we were able to. It is pricey, but it‚Äôs central London, so to be expected.

Would definitely go back."
Tattu London,5.0,"This has to be one of my favourites restaurants in the world.
The service, the food and the prices were outstanding.
I was so amazed by paying only ¬£38 for this amazing food, the place is so lovely. Couldn't believe it. 10/10"
Tattu London,5.0,"Went for a family dinner and it was lovely.
Food is good, service is excellent and the atmosphere is beautiful.
Zsanett was an excellent waitress, kind and professional.
Dani was also really nice.
We definitely recommend!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Amazing experience.
We ordered the 3 course meal (+2 side dishes), and everything was delicious. The presentation was marvelous and the service provided by Ahmed was perfect.
Recomended!"
Tattu London,5.0,Absolutely incredible. The food was unbelievable and the service was impressive. Every cocktail I had was amazing. The outside bar is really cute and all the views from the restaurant are impressive
Tattu London,5.0,"An Amazing Experience at Tattu London!
We accidentally booked a table at the Manchester location instead of London, but the team was incredibly kind and accommodating in resolving the mix-up. Despite the Christmas Eve rush, they ensured we had a wonderful evening.
The food was absolutely fantastic‚Äîrefined flavors and beautifully presented. The dragon cocktail was a delightful surprise: unique, delicious, and a real treat. The interior was absolutely stunning, with an elegant and modern design that created the perfect atmosphere for a special evening.
A special thanks to Lin, who made our evening even more special with her friendliness and excellent service. Highly recommend for anyone who loves great food, unique drinks, and exceptional service in a breathtaking setting. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Tattu London,5.0,"We came here to celebrate our first wedding anniversary - we couldn't have asked for a nicer night. The food and service both were incredible - Our waitress Lin was fantastic, she sent us a complimentary dessert to help us celebrate and she gave us some brilliant recommendations - the Shanghai black cod and caramel soy aged beef were our favourites. We went for the Taste of Tattu set menu and the portions were huge - we couldn't even finish it all. Would highly recommend"
Tattu London,5.0,"Gorgeous restaurant,  excellent service, and excellent food. We particularly enjoyed the squid started, the steaks, and the desserts! Huge thanks to Raul and the team for the little birthday surprise! <3"
Tattu London,5.0,"Came as a walk in - reception team was sooooo welcoming I lived for the girlsssss üíñ thank you to Bernadetta, Dora, Kia and Aysha for making our birthday celebration amazing!
Thank you to Amed and Dennis for the splendid recommendations!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Excellent atmosphere, perfect service. The foos is not only presented like an art but also delicious. Cannot wait to go back to London just to dine in Tatu!"
Tattu London,5.0,"From the moment we stepped in, Raul was super attentive, gave us some really great recommendations on the food and had a great sense of humour, had a wonderful evening! The hazelnut chocolate pagoda is a must!"
Tattu London,5.0,"It is a magical place, I went there for the first time and was amazed.  The atmosphere was great, the place looks so beautiful with the Sakura trees,  just wow!!!!! The lady who was serving our table Lin was very nice, friendly and very helpful,  she explained everything by the menu and suggested many things. The cocktail I had called Scull Candy- its so good, if you like sweet cocktails, i will recommend to try it.
It was great experience,  I highly recommend this place."
Tattu London,5.0,"Excellent Service and Great Experience!

I had a fantastic dining experience at Tattu, and a big part of that was thanks to our amazing waiter, Raul. From the moment we sat down, they were attentive, friendly, and professional. They took the time to explain the menu, offered great recommendations, and made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.

Our drinks were always refilled promptly, and the food arrived at the perfect pace. What stood out the most was [specific detail, e.g., ‚Äútheir warm and welcoming attitude‚Äù or ‚Äúhow they went out of their way to accommodate a special request‚Äù].

Overall, the service was outstanding, and Raul truly made our evening special. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back!"
Tattu London,4.0,Fantastic venue with good views and excellent customer service... food was very good but a bit over sauced...little too rich for my liking but definitely still worth a visit... especially for larger groups and a special occasion
Tattu London,5.0,"The place is unbelievable great. The atmosphere is amazing. Loved how they decorated the dining room, especially the cherry tree in the middle of the room. The food is great. Had brunch option and enjoyed every minute of my experience. Service is great, very attentive and friendly people. Highly recommend it for any occasion."
Tattu London,5.0,"Great experience at Tattu London. The location and view is great.
The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. I asked extra dim sums  in the mixed set as we were 3 and they arranged it without breaking a sweat.
The food was very fresh. Some dishes were a little bit too salty for my liking but it is down to preferences.
For me the highlight was the Wagyu, the fishmonk and the pork bao.
While for some of my friends, they loved the mushroom truffle spring rolls, the angry bird, and the clay pot.
After seeing pics and reviews, I thought the rice portion would be small but they were pretty generous.
The dim sums were very pretty, the colours were gorgeous.

We didn‚Äôt manage to reach the dessert stage as we were pretty full but overlooking other tables they looked outstanding.

A great variety of dishes to pick from.
Very nice spot in London for special occasions."
Tattu London,2.0,"Pretty interior.  Faux trees were very cute. Food was good, but tbh very overpriced.  Air con was too cold, despite being adjusted.  Staff were way too overtly keen to get good online reviews.  Wouldn't go back."
Tattu London,5.0,Ahmed was a fantastic server and made our experience so special. He was especially attentive to any dietary restrictions that our group had. Will certainly be returning.
Tattu London,3.0,"Beautiful restaurant with an ok ambiance, however the service let this place down. Admittedly we were late for our reservation but there was a complete lack of communication around seating us. After about an hour and a half at the bar, we were seated and the food was tasty. We had the pork buns(delicious), waygu dumpling (not my cup of tea), duck fried rice (delicious), pork ribs and beef short rib. The protein was way too fatty. It felt like I was chewing fat mostly, which put me off to be honest. Desert (lemon drop) was delicious. The cocktails were also decent but I‚Äôve had better; I went for the Chinese New Year Special. Overall, I think the food quality and  service needs to improve to justify the ¬£100+ per head price."
Tattu London,2.0,"My fiance took me to London for my birthday and we decided to celebrate it at Tattu.

We were greeted by a wonderful server who is the only reason this place doesn't get 1 star. I won't mention her name as to not get her in trouble as it wasn't her fault that the meal never made it to our table.

The manager saw that we had our appetizers and asked if everything was OK and we said yes and he decided to cut the kitchen early. He asked if we were still waiting for food as we had been waiting patiently and we said yes of course. We are waiting for the entrees we ordered. He said he was sorry but he assumed the appetizers were all we were eating and since we said everything was good we didnt need the entrees that we ordered?

He apologized and said he would comp our appetizers but still left 2 on the bill.

We weren't going to cause a fuss but if we are going to spend one of our few nights in london at your establishment, celebrating a meaningful day and ready to spend hundreds of dollars these types of things are simply unacceptable.

Also if you say you are going to comp the appetizers you should do as you say. We flew in from overseas and decided to spend one of our meals here and we were left totally disappointed.

The only saving grace was our lovely server. She was warm and inviting and truly sorry for what happened even though it was not her fault. We saw her ring in the entrees and the manager came to us much later than the order was rang in.

All in all hugely disappointed.

Added.. here's a pic of me looking for our entrees."
Tattu London,5.0,"had the pleasure of being served by Lin during both of my visits to Tattu London, and I must say she is truly outstanding. Lin embodies everything you‚Äôd hope for in a top-tier waitress‚Äîwarm, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. Her ability to make you feel welcomed and well taken care of is unmatched.

Both times, she anticipated our needs without being intrusive, made thoughtful recommendations, and carried herself with genuine kindness and professionalism. Lin‚Äôs service elevated our dining experience and left a lasting impression.

Thank you, Lin, for your consistency, charm, and excellence. Tattu is lucky to have you!"
Tattu London,5.0,We had a very elegant night out in the middle of central London. The restaurant is at the top of a new hotel and the place was buzzing from the time we entered toll the time we left. Each dish was cooked precisely and had good flavour combinations that worked well together. The cocktails also complimented the dishes we ate too. Would recommend Tattu for a business dinner or special occasion
Tattu London,5.0,An unforgettable experience. Will definitely go again. We had an incredible view over Tottenham court road and the Dominion Theater. It was the perfect place to have our Masters graduation dinner.
Tattu London,5.0,"We had a fantastic meal here for my birthday. My wife and I really enjoyed the whole experience. The whole place has been decorated beautifully. We started with cocktails on the terrace and then moved into the restaurant. We had the Tattu Signature menu and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The portions were so large that we had to take some away with us. I would like to make a special thank you to Lin, who was serving us, for being very helpful and kind and made the whole experience run like clockwork."
Tattu London,5.0,"Our waitress was Lin, she was so helpful and knowledgeable, guided us through the menu and provided her recommendations. Her recommendations are top tier, she loves the food and wants to share that love with her guest! Her hospitality is so warm and welcoming, it was a pleasure to have her host us on our anniversary dinner. We felt so special!"
Tattu London,5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at Tattu in London again today, and, as always, it was nothing short of delightful. The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äì full of flavour and beautifully presented ‚Äì and the atmosphere remains as charming and stylish as ever.

A special mention must go to Bruna, my waitress, who was wonderfully kind, attentive, and genuinely helpful throughout. She made the experience all the more enjoyable.

Tattu continues to be one of those rare places where excellent service, great ambience, and outstanding food come together seamlessly. I left thoroughly satisfied and am already looking forward to my next visit."
Tattu London,5.0,"I love a lovely date here with my boyfriend. The ambience and the food was amazing. Best part was Aysa, she was very kind and she recommended food. I will definitely come. Back"
Tattu London,3.0,"We opted for the Signatures sharing menu, and while the food was great - especially Shanghai Black Cod - the experience fell short of expectations.

The Ice Dragon dessert, while creative, didn‚Äôt particularly impress us. Service left much to be desired. Small but significant lapses, like serving a cocktail with a piece of paper stuck to the bottom of the glass and bringing dessert too soon after the main course. Watching the server awkwardly circle the restaurant to delay serving the dessert emphasized the lack of attention to timing.

Additionally, the venue was uncomfortably warm, and the music was a bit too loud, detracting from what should have been a more relaxed and enjoyable meal.

Cocktails were decent though, and the decor was undeniably beautiful.

While the food quality was high, the overall experience felt pretentious and overpriced for what was delivered. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt recommend this place."
Tattu London,5.0,"really nice atmosphere and excellent service by Lin. we were blown away by the food, especially the starters. highly recommend and would come back to try the other menu items"
Tattu London,5.0,"I had the absolute pleasure to have a dinner reservation at Tattu London for my birthday accompanied by my mother and sister. I do not usually do reviews but this time I just have to. I say absolute pleasure because this is how it was from the helpful and friendly people at the entrance, to the ambiance, to the Alex‚Äôs service, to the quality of food and the deliver, to the little and thoughtful surprise they prepared for me. From professionalism explaining and showing everything on the menu, to the balance between making you feel like home but respecting your time and space. It was absolutely impeccable and I will always recommend this place to everyone with all my heart. Alex‚Äôs service, energy and attention were outstanding and delivered with class, mindfulness and demureness. Thank youuu guys for everything you are the best and you have my love forever!! <3"
Tattu London,5.0,"Lin was a great host, atmosphere was good, great food with amazing views and scenery - definitely book for your birthday and special occasion"
Tattu London,5.0,"The food was amazing. Absolutely delicious. Each bite was an explosion of flavours. The decor was out of this world, entirely mesmerising. Lin was a perfect host. Welcoming, warm and tasteful. Awesome place to enjoy birthday, we will be coming back. Thank you Tattu for a the evening to remember and the pictures to admire. Thank you Lin for your hospitality."
Tattu London,5.0,"Unforgettable Celebration at Tattu LondonWe recently celebrated my wife's birthday and our 3rd wedding anniversary at Tattu London and it was an absolutely incredible experience. The food was simply divine - every dish was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation. It was the perfect combination of elegance and taste.We were particularly impressed by our new waiter, who was exceptional. His attentive and friendly service elevated our dining experience to a whole new level.We would also like to commend the entire staff for their patience and kindness towards our son. He can be challenging at times, but everyone went above and beyond to make him feel comfortable and welcome.Thank you, Tattu London, for creating such a memorable evening for our family. We will definitely be back! Again and again! Many thanks üòä"
Tattu London,5.0,"My friends and I went to TATTU on Saturday.
We had made a booking a few months in advance for 5 people. However, on the day one of us couldn‚Äôt make it, so I called to say that it would only be 4 people. They were very accommodating and said that would be fine.

When you arrive, they have a cloak room to leave your coat. I kept my coat with me and they brought us to our table. It is such a beautiful restaurant with a great ambiance and vibe. Oriental elements and beautiful blossom tree in the middle. We had a really good table.

There were lots of options on the menu. I opted for the Caramel Soy Aged Beef fillet. I asked for it to be Medium Rare, this was so delicious and I highly recommend it. My friends enjoyed their meals also.

The service was great, it was obviously very busy for a Saturday evening, but the staff were so good. They kept our water refilled and they checked if we were enjoying our food. Even though they were busy, they had smiles on their faces. Very thankful to them for making us have a great experience.

There is also a rooftop bar bit. We spent time there taking lots of photos and enjoying our time. It is also closer to their live DJ.

Price was decent as well, a little over ¬£60 per person. Which is a great deal. Would definitely come again."
Tattu London,5.0,"Here in London celebrating our 35th anniversary and doing what we have always done - searching for good food.
Tattu came up on radar and we decided to try.
Place is beautiful and offers great views of the city. The staff is very friendly and made us feel welcomed.
We ordered Modern Sharing with its four waves, ranging from starter to dessert.
Every single item on each of the waves was deliciously prepared and neatly arranged.
The size of each item served is plenty and we were well satisfied 3/4 of the way down the list. The dessert had to be boxed and eaten later.
Our server, Matthew, was very professional yet kind and friendly.
One of the best restaurants we have been in years. Highly recommend it."
Tattu London,4.0,"Delicious Chinese food! The interior design is beautiful, from the indoor tree to the furniture and tableware. There are many options to choose from, and during certain days, there‚Äôs a special you can opt in for. The food was great overall, but certain dishes were rather average. The mushroom bun was almost mind blowing. They put effort into decoration and using various flavours and textures im the dishes. The service was very kind overall but not very attentive as we came during a busy time during the weekend."
Tattu London,5.0,"Me and my partner had a lovely meal here over the weekend. The food was amazing, we went with the Modern sharing option. Great choice if you want to try a few different things and lots of food. We had a lovely waiter called Denis. Thank you for your friendly service. The decor and atmosphere did not disappoint. We will definitely return üôÇ"
Tattu London,5.0,Honestly one of my favourite restaurants tried various menus this is my 3rd time and our host Ahmed was amazing food is to die for!
Tattu London,5.0,"Food was amazing. Ahmed, our waiter was lovely.we hat the 3 couse set menu, portions were good."
Tattu London,5.0,"The food was absolutely outstanding. I‚Äôve dined in many restaurants around the world, but the quality and preparation here were truly next level. Every dish was a masterpiece ‚Äî perfectly balanced, beautifully presented, and full of flavor.

The staff were incredibly courteous and attentive throughout the entire evening. A heartfelt thank you to Michele and Raul, who took exceptional care of me and made the experience even more special. I felt truly welcomed and appreciated as a guest.

Highly recommended ‚Äî I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Tattu London,5.0,Melissa you are an exceptional host and ambassador for Tattu ..food drinks exceptional üëå missed having the dj but the in-house music was not bad ...we had a fantastic time
Tattu London,5.0,"First time at this absolutely gorgeous restaurant in London, just a few minutes from Tottenham Court Road!

Upon arrival, we checked in with the receptionist and shared our reservation details. We then took the lift to the 6th floor.

The views from there were stunning! The restaurant itself felt like a conservatory with its glass ceilings, beautifully decorated in a chic oriental style.

We were seated at a reserved space for four, which was much better than a table in the middle.

For lunch, we opted for the set menu, which included two courses and unlimited cocktails from a selection of four. (See photos!)

I tried all four cocktails. My favorite was the apple one, served in a half-sphere round glass and green in color. The cherry and pineapple cocktails were also delicious, and the grapefruit one was quite special.

We will definitely be back‚Äîthe experience was top-notch.

Totally recommend!!! ^_^"
Tattu London,5.0,"Amazing service from Lin, she was so friendly and welcoming. Furthermore the food was fabulous, so packed with flavour. Impeccable service!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Tattu London is a truly stunning dining destination that combines incredible design, exceptional food, and a mesmerizing atmosphere. The decor is absolutely breathtaking, with intricate details and ambient lighting that create a cosy and romantic setting, perfect for special occasions or an unforgettable night out.

One of the standout features is the stunning view from the large glass windows overlooking the London streets. It‚Äôs truly mesmerizing and adds a magical touch to the dining experience, blending the restaurant‚Äôs chic interior with the beauty of the city outside.

The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring fast and efficient service that makes you feel well taken care of. The overall cleanliness and attention to detail are impeccable, further elevating the experience.

As for the food‚Äîoutstanding in every way. Every dish was served at the perfect temperature and packed with flavor. The chicken dishes were the absolute highlight, tender and perfectly seasoned, while the noodles were equally delicious and beautifully presented.

Tattu London is a place where every element, from the food to the decor and the captivating city views, comes together flawlessly. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an elevated and memorable dining experience!"
Tattu London,5.0,"Another great meal at Tattu. The service was faultless as usual, Lin looked after us very well.
Food was good just felt all the sauces were a little sweet this time would have liked my angry wok chicken more spicey and less sweet. But that my only complaint, the cherry ice cream we had as a dessert was very tasty.
Be back in December for out Firms Xmas party."
Tattu London,5.0,"During our evening visit to Tattu in London, we were absolutely impressed. This restaurant offers an exceptional Chinese cuisine experience, blending traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques.

The food was nothing short of delicious ‚Äì every dish was beautifully presented and packed with flavor. It‚Äôs clear that great attention is paid to both quality and detail in their menu.

The ambiance was another highlight of the evening. The space is atmospheric, with a stylish and elegant design that creates a warm and welcoming vibe, perfect for a memorable night out.

Finally, the staff were delightful ‚Äì friendly, attentive, and professional, ensuring our dining experience was smooth and enjoyable.

If you‚Äôre looking for an extraordinary Chinese dining experience in London, Tattu is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"
Tattu London,5.0,"OK, so it's decadently expensive, our meal for 2 with 2 bottles of wine was over ¬£350, but the food is also astonishingly good, the service from Maria so spot on and the interior design, music and vibe so on-point it's absolutely worth it.
A real treat for a special occasion."
Fallow,,Óóä
Fallow,5.0,"Ate at Fallow last night. Believe the hype, it‚Äôs very good. We were served by Christian, he is an excellent ambassador for the business. His knowledge of the menu and his advice on dishes were really helpful.
The food is innovative, beautiful and tastes amazing. We ate some of the famous dishes, corn ribs, mushroom parfait, cod‚Äôs head and they were all excellent.
A very decent wine list and good cocktails to get things going."
Fallow,5.0,"Went to Fallow twice recently. Was very happy both times. Food was great, service was excellent & atmosphere pretty good as a whole. I was particularly impressed with their head to tail choice of ingredients. Mindful some may find part of the menu too adventurous, it will surely satisfy those who are more used to a greater choice of ingredients or who are open to something more exotic or different. The best dishes in my first visit were Cod‚Äôs Head, mushroom parfait & corn ribs. I also like octopus crumpet & beef tartare. The only dish I found not as good as some I had tried before was possibly beef ribs. Second time I tried their roasted pig‚Äôs head. It was quite an experience. We were very impressed with the way how this pretty unthinkable giant of a dish was executed, served & tasted. I do have to give a warning though the dish is pretty fatty & filling. It will be a good idea to share it amongst at least 4 people if not six."
Fallow,5.0,Really good lunch on a Sunday. We had the roast beef with a side of cauliflower and broccoli cheese which was awesome. The cod‚Äôs head lived up to all expectations and I‚Äôd highly recommend. Chips on the side to mop up all the amazing sauce was a win. We were super full at the end but the sweetcorn ice cream was too good to say no to. Definitely retuning here.
Fallow,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant restaurant, would highly recommend.

We had the beef ribs, corn ribs and cod‚Äôs head with fries. The corn ribs were outstanding and the beef ribs were excellent. The cod‚Äôs head was very good also especially with the addition of the fries, though it does take 5-10 minutes to get over the fact that it is, in fact, a big cod‚Äôs head on your plate!

Our server Josh C was polite, attentive and helpful with menu suggestions and we enjoyed a brief chat at the end of the meal about Fallow and the sister restaurants, Fowl and Roe, Which are next on my list to visit!

They were also kind enough to provide us with a complementary dessert to share in celebration of our anniversary, which was very much appreciated."
Fallow,5.0,"Literally the best restaurant experience I have had. The staff were very attentive to the point where they were topping up our water and changing the empty bottles without us noticing.

The food was spectacular. Every element was perfectly balanced and looked beautiful! The hardest part was seeing diners order other dishes and having food envy. Out of everything I tried the Chelsea tart really stole the show.

I will definitely be back again!"
Fallow,5.0,"Tried Fallow for the first time and got the Corn ribs, mushroom parfait and cod head. All three were very good but my favourite has to be the mushroom parfait. I also recommend sitting at the kitchen bar as it was very entertaining watching the team operate in such as fast paced environment. Special shout out to Isabella who was my server for the night. She provided excellent recommendations and went above and beyond in terms of the level of care. Thanks to the entire team for a great first dinner in London!"
Fallow,5.0,"Visited here by myself spontaneously for my birthday without booking, was bit busy but luckily got the bar seat which is good for the solo diner.
The corn rib was a bit tricky to eat well but i loved the seasoning and steak was very soft and tasty. And also i got the Tomato Salad and it was really good with the cheese and crunchy something.
Server named Jack was very friendly and all the other servers were so nice and caring any inconvenience or how the food is, and i loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. Of course it‚Äôs in central London so was but pricy but recommended to spend your day on special occasion."
Fallow,5.0,"Excellent service, innovative dishes and cocktails, always lovely coming here and I don't think there's anything on the menu that I wouldn't try/haven't tried that was less than amazing. Took my mum a few days ago, and even though she normally neither drinks cocktails nor eats anything smoked, she loved her rhubarb spritz and was sorely tempted to lick the plate of her ribs clean.  I love that everything is so well thought through and rounded, and that there are so many small dishes to share, because, truly, you just want to try everything from this spectacular menu. Big shout out to the amazing waiters and waitresses as well, who are all very lovely and attentive! Always a good and special night out!"
Fallow,5.0,"This was such a superb restaurant, our waiter, Thomas, gave us excellent recommendations from the very beginning and provided us with top tier service throughout the evening. The food was excellent, there was not a single dish we had anything but praise for! The corn ribs and mushroom parfait are both must have dishes. Sitting at the chefs counter was incredibly fun, getting to watch your food being made and seeing the energy of the kitchen made for a really cool atmosphere that you only get by having the kitchen be ‚Äúcentre stage‚Äù in the restaurant space."
Fallow,5.0,"Stellar experience overall from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. Each staff member we interacted with was lovely and so attentive. Our server Tomos, did an excellent job reviewing our selections and ensuring we had the perfect amount of food for our group of 7 adults and one child. Wine and water were frequently filled, plates were cleared and exchanged as soon as needed. This is a family style service so I think it‚Äôs best enjoyed in a group to get to experience as much as possible. I also want to call out the exceptional service at the front desk. We ordered around 5 starter/small plates and three entrees and two sides and shared the sweet corn dessert. Mushroom parfait, sourdough bread, burrata, short ribs, duck pancake; cod‚Äôs head, tandoori cauliflower, rib eye, potatoes and cabbage; cocktails and wine; sweet corn soft serve. Our server heavily recommended the mushroom parfait and the person who doesn‚Äôt like mushrooms in the group even agreed it was fantastic. I think my overall favorite was the duck pancake. Absolutely fantastic and a brilliant experience."
Fallow,5.0,"Visited Fallow for dinner to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. The food was unreal. Best bites were: corn ribs, mushroom parfait, and the fallow burger. Akira was a friendly, attentive and professional server. Our table was great too, right by the window for some good people-watching on Haymarket. Highly recommended for a delicious and indulgent meal."
Fallow,4.0,"Great attentive service, starters came out super quick. Kitchen bar seats were a great view. Non alcoholic cocktails were delicious.

Corn ribs 8/10 yummy but something I could easily recreate at home

Mushroom parfait 8.5/10. Lovely flavour, great bread

Beef ribs 9/10 lovely BBQ char flavour, fall off the bone tender

Chicken roast 8/10 huge portion of meat. Enough for 2 people. Potatoes nice and crispy, side veg were all very good. Nice savory gravy

Cods head, 7.5/10 fish was very fresh and cooked well but needed more seasoning, sauce was a bit one note and got a bit boring. Needed more of a kick. Lots of meat on the head.

Chips 8/10 same flavouring as the corn, nice and crispy

Salted corn soft serve 9/10 lovely balance of sweet, savory crunchy.

All very good generous sized portions"
Fallow,5.0,"The food was straight way amazing. One of the best things I have had in a while. The corn rips are a perfect start, the mushroom parfait is so rich in flavor and the miso eggplant really just super delicious. As a dessert I can really recommend the sweet corn - heaven!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great dinner at Fallow last week before our theater show. Shout out to our server Toby who was attentive, knowledgeable, and helped us pick out some really tasty dishes. The vibes are great for a date or with a group of friends. Everything tasted great - highlights were the rhubarb cocktail, mushroom toast (divine!), and cod head with chips. Would definitely return!"
Fallow,5.0,"Great ambience! Great food! My husband follows their YouTube channel and we wanted to visit on our trip to London!

The corn ribs are a must order! Beef short ribs were delicious! Everything was cooked to perfection
Sweet corn brown butter soft serve was also exceptional !

Want to go back to try their cod‚Äôs head

Staff was also friendly, reservations are really recommended as they get busy !"
Fallow,5.0,"I booked a seat for one and was placed at the bar, where I loved the vibes. The staff were incredibly nice, and the service was exceptional. Every dish I tried was delightful!

The mushroom parfait was surprisingly good, and the crispy corn seasoning was delicious. The ribs were tender and juicy, and the sauce elevated them to another level. Lastly, the beef fillet was one of the best I've had, complemented perfectly by the accompanying sauces."
Fallow,5.0,"Our waiter was super friendly, and we absolutely loved everything we ordered!
We highly recommend the beef ribs and the corn rice dessert. Outstanding! The ribs were super savory and juicy while the dessert was creamy and tasty.
There was a small band that came and sang to us for a while: it was lovely!
It's not a cheap place, but it is worth it!!
Super recommendable place"
Fallow,5.0,"What a great experience. After watching a number of YouTube  reviews over the past few months, we had high expectations, these were not only met but exceeded. We were here for a Sunday lunch, from the very moment we entered the service was professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The cocktails were incredible especially the gin rhubarb one.

We had the corn ribs and beef ribs as a starter, the amount of flavour in both was incredible.

The Sunday roast was the best I have had,  the beef had so much flavour, complimented by the perfectly cooked vegetables.

We do not normally have desert, however shared the rhubarb and ginger cheesecake, again incredible combinations of flavour.

Overall a great experience of high quality food, in a relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely be back, next time we are in London.

A big thanks to all the staff."
Fallow,2.0,"For the tourists: This place is a disappointment. It's overhyped and the reviews are flooded by locals who raise the overall score of the restaurant. Please do not visit.

Food:
The execution is really not good. This is despite all the social media hype, all the technique they showcase. The beef ribs lack body, the potato waffle cheese sauce lacks body as well and has this slight bitterness which wasn't good. The mushroom parfait was absolutely delicious, it's got great depth of flavour and complexity. Apparently it's a 3-4day process and it shows, the bread was good too.

The fallow burger was sad. Despite the nduja, the overall burger tastes so bland. The pickles were so mild, and the candied bacon was terrible.

Chelsea tart was good, however the milk ice cream was too mild. And the tart was too salty

Service: they were very annoyed with us ordering a few dishes at once, but they mentioned from the start that the food comes as and when. It's very confusing why they have a problem with it and they keep telling us it slows down the kitchen, which made no sense when they're not a fine dining place that has to ensure everything coming at once. They keep harping on it without properly explaining why. There was one nice lady who was in charge of us though

Atmosphere: Very packed and rowdy and tight place"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a wonderful experience at Fallow. This was my second time in London, first time at this restaurant and our waiter Tomos made us feel very welcome and right at home. He was super friendly and thoughtful. We even received a small anniversary dessert. The food was great, every dish was unique and delicious in its own way. We would recommend dining at the chef‚Äôs counter but you‚Äôll need to make a reservation. The staff in the kitchen were extremely hard working and professional.  A well oiled machine with an eye for detail and hygiene. It was a great evening ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you Fallow staff!"
Fallow,5.0,"After watching YouTube videos from Fallow for months, when I had a trip to London planned I could not have been more excited. I walked in with high expectations and they were all met or  exceeded.

The service was some of the best I had ever had. Every item of food that hit our table was excellent. Both the corn and beef ribs were delicious...the corn in a way I couldn't have expected. The tartare and mushrooms were great. Even my kids dinner were wonderful. And the desserts...its tough to know what to say. The caramelized whey tart is not something I'm easily able to describe. Think a pie filled with caramel, but not as heavy and with an amazing texture. The brown butter ice cream changed the way I envision the possibilities of ice cream.

I cannot recommend Fallow highly enough. We've even considered a return trip to London simply for a show and dinner here."
Fallow,4.0,"We tried the corn ribs, beef ribs, mushroom parfait, cod head, Rhubarb & Custard cocktail, and Mandarin Mimosa cocktail. The mushroom parfait was our absolute favourite‚Äîrich and full of flavour! The corn ribs were also delicious. The cod head was definitely an interesting dish, but well worth trying.

A big thank you to Anna, who served our table‚Äîshe was thoughtful, attentive, and gave us excellent food recommendations throughout the meal."
Fallow,5.0,Fallow is amazing. Retirement and anniversary breakfast celebration did not disappoint! Service was very attentive from the minute you walked in. Set at the chef‚Äôs table which was entertaining and intriguing. Breakfast croissant was so tasty and put together beautifully. Hash browns were crispy and fluffy all in the same bite. Restaurant was spotless and it is obvious to see why Fallow has such a good reputation. Would like to return for lunch on another visit.
Fallow,5.0,"Really wonderful restaurant. So happy I decided to pop in for early dinner. They accommodated me even though I was without reservation and dining alone. I gotta say my server Josh C. Had some amazing recommendations, the mushroom mousse was a must try! Thanks for that one! The duck pancake was my fav for sure. Really amazing and the staff were very genuine and seemed to love the work. If you can check it out, you MUST!"
Fallow,5.0,"Very tasty food with bar seating at Fallow on a Sunday eve. Jack, our waiter, went above and beyond to recommend his favorite dishes and we even got some compliments from the kitchen and bar staff, which was very unexpected and kind. Recommend for some British bites from a kitchen and bar staff that has craftsmanship."
Fallow,5.0,"I just had one of the most incredible dining experiences in London! Every moment was a delight, thanks to the amazing food and top-notch service. Our wonderful server, Amanda, was an absolute gem, and the fantastic manager Josh, along with Rommel and sommelier Priyance, truly outdid themselves to make our meal unforgettable. They went above and beyond, especially for one of us, ensuring we felt extra special. I had such a fantastic time ‚Äì I can't wait to return the next time I'm in London!"
Fallow,5.0,"Had the opportunity to visit London for a work trip and was looking forward to dining here as a lone diner, having followed the very informative and entertaining YouTube channel for a while. Was pretty jetlagged after a long journey from Australia but managed to get a booking for a seat at the Chef's counter on a busy Wednesday evening last week. Highly recommend the experience. Food was excellent, service was attentive and expeditious. Mushroom parfait was a highlight. It was a privelege being seated right adjacent the chef's pass and watching the kitchen team work together with great speed, skill, cohesion and chemistry. It was a very busy service just after 6PM and it was a pleasure watching the head chef lead the service seamlessly with great calmness and efficiency - the communication, camaraderie, and above all, palpable joy with which the team worked was reflected in the atmosphere of the place and the quality of the dishes served. A most memorable experience and one I would hope to repeat again in the future."
Fallow,5.0,"Absolutely love Fallow!
The food is incredible‚Äîdelicious, creative, and full of surprises. They make amazing dishes using parts of ingredients that most people usually discard, and the results are impressive.
I highly recommend sitting at the chef‚Äôs counter‚Äîit‚Äôs like dinner and a show, watching the chefs in action.
Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fallow, Fallow, Fallow.. You just got everything right! From the second I walked in, I was in heaven. The staff was so friendly, full of energy, and informative. I was served by Josh and he was awesome. I felt like it was a personal experience. The food, oh my goodness. Every dish and drink I had was incredible. So well thought of and creative. All the flavors just hit and the time/effort that goes into creating these is felt. Every first bite of each dish was a wow moment for me. I encourage you to watch the videos on their Instagram and see how the dishes are created! To top it all off, this place is sustainable. From growing their own mushrooms there to repurposing their oyster shells, they make that effort to be a sustainable establishment. I left with a huge smile on my face and I cannot wait to visit again for another Fallow experience."
Fallow,5.0,"I absolutely loved the corn ribs, mushroom parfait, cod head, beef burger and Sunday roast of roasted pork. The Dragon Punch for non-alcoholic drinkers is refreshing. All yummy! üòç and we were served by Ana who was most courteous and friendly, we loved her smile üòä"
Fallow,5.0,"We sat at the Chef's Counter overlooking the kitchen which kept us entertained, and in awe, watching the chefs create mouth watering dishes. The service was exceptional and our waiter Toby was attentive, charming and knowledgeable on both the food and wine. They also surprised us with dessert for our anniversary which was very special. My favourite dish was the burrata and my husband's was the cod's head. We can't wait to visit again."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience while celebrating our anniversary here. The service was friendly and all staff were incredibly welcoming. The sparkler was a nice touch! The food was good but not outstanding; the salmon croissant roll was tasty but nothing memorable, the mushroom toast was very flavourful, thanks to the wild garlic pesto, though the broccoli on it felt a bit out of place. My favorite was the blueberry cake with poppyseed crumble which was delicious. Would definitely be coming back to try lunch/dinner."
Fallow,5.0,4 people - we ordered 15 food items and some drinks. EVERYTHING was amazing! Seasoned to limit but not over. Outstanding cooking techniques. Crazy good service. Best restaurant without a star I have ever been. Absolutely worth going there!!!
Fallow,3.0,"While most of the food was exceptionally good, the burgers were remarkably dull, 2/5, buns weren't great, meat was dry, you can get a MUCH better burger from Five Guys/Honest Burger. Just avoid the burgers and you'll be fine.
Overall, great food, excellent drinks, but average value for money. The service was very good."
Fallow,4.0,"The food at Fallow Restaurant was very good. Highlights included the corn ribs and the black cod head, which were amazing. However, the service lacked attention and forgot the birthday celebration."
Fallow,5.0,"Just had the most amazing Sunday lunch!  Seriously, everything was perfect.  Started with the corn ribs and duck pancakes, which were both incredible. Then we went for the full roast and wow, just wow. So much delicious food, perfectly cooked. Definitely going back for more soon. Highly recommend checking this place out if you can! Best Sunday lunch I've had in ages.

It was my birthday and they even brought out a sparkler with the desserts"
Fallow,5.0,"Faultless food and perfect service - thank you Aston for the excellent explanations and guidance! We were a party of 3 and shared the mushroom parfait, beef ribs (we had two portions), octopus muffin, corn ribs, aubergine, tomato salad and sourdough bread. Standouts were the mushroom parfait and the aubergine - just stunning. We thought it couldn't get better and then we shared the Rhubarb mousse and Chelsea Tart - unanimously, the two best desserts we had ever had. I will be dreaming about the food and looking forward to my next visit."
Fallow,5.0,"Second time coming to Fallow, this time for mine and my boyfriend‚Äôs 2 year anniversary. He‚Äôs been a few times and is absolutely in love with the place, as am I! We were served by Manisha who was attentive, friendly and gave us two drinks on the house, and made us feel really looked after. She made the evening! All the food was gorgeous - Jack was in the kitchen, and we were lucky enough to meet and thank him, he was really friendly and down to earth. The whole kitchen and service team are brilliant. Truly amazing. I‚Äôll always come back to Fallow!"
Fallow,5.0,"Incredible food that lives up to the hype, the mushroom parfait is delicious. What really made this a special experience however was the service from Vivian - genuinely the kindest, warmest service we have EVER had. She was so charismatic and made our anniversary lunch so memorable. Give that girl a raise x"
Fallow,5.0,"Great food and staff. The corn ribs were definitely special. The oysters are served with delicious shallots and their special sriracha which was fire. The mushroom parfait was really rich. The duck pancake was really great too. Finally, the burger was really rich and beefy. I would say it is not for everyone as the intense beef flavor can be overwhelming for some but for me it was perfect. The desert of Chelsea Tart was bomb!

Our waiter, Gabriel, was excellent. Very attentive and friendly."
Fallow,5.0,Booked for dinner with family. What an amazing experience. Akira did a great job with menu suggestions and was very attentive. Had pig's head!! Unforgettable. definitely return.
Fallow,5.0,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday treat. We sat at the 'Chefs Counter' - something I highly recommend you do. You will get to see the chefs working in full swing up close.

The dishes were all spectacular. Our favourites were the Scallop Ceviche and the Tandoori cauliflower. You should not leave without trying the corn ribs.

The wine list catered to a wide range of budgets.

The desserts were fantastic. I can strongly recommend you try the Chelsea tart - it was smooth and creamy.

To round it all off, we had Espresso Martinis, which was by quite far the best one I've ever had.

I will be back. I'm eyeing the cod's head, and the pig's head.

Only loses the point off atmosphere as it was slightly too loud for me."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a fantastic final meal in London at Fallow, made even more special by our amazing waiter Jack.

The food was outstanding‚Äîwe especially loved the corn ribs, ricotta, oysters, and the beef main plate. Every dish was creative and full of flavor.

At the end of our meal, Jack told us he‚Äôd pulled some strings and arranged a surprise: a move from our corner bar seats to the chef‚Äôs counter for a complimentary dessert and final fun experience for the night!

Jack was gracious, attentive, and truly went above and beyond. We‚Äôll be recommending Fallow to everyone we know for sure. Thanks for the perfect send-off!"
Fallow,5.0,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint. We started with the beef ribs and the potato waffle both of which were amazing but the beef ribs fell off the bone and I would highly recommend.
For mains we had the Fallow burger and the Sandy Black Pork. Both dishes were easily some of the best we have had. At this point we were stuffed but out comes a bowl of soft serve ice creams with some caramel sauce and caramelised cornflakes and a sparkler to wish us a happy anniversary. This tasted so good and it was incredibly thoughtful of the team.
Our waiter Calvin was amazing.  Constantly refreshing our water. Clearing the table and just made our experience even better.
If you are even considering going to Fallow, let this be the reason you decide to go!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fabulous place - we arrived at 3 on a Friday afternoon and the restaurant was very busy and buzzing. David the Maitr'd was very welcoming and Troy our waiter was very knowledgeable and talked us through the dishes (I had no idea what Hen of the Wood was, or Pink Fur Potatoes for that matter.) Everything was delicious but our personal favourites were the ribs and the mushroom parfait. I had the cods head as the big dish, because I had never seen it on a menu before and like to try new dishes. Again it tasted amazing though if you're going all in I would recommend trying the eyeball first as it has a very unusual taste and the dish just gets better and better after that. Thanks also to Toby the sommelier for helping us pick out some lovely wines.
Oh and the fries were the absolute best I've ever tasted! Would love to know the recipe and try them at home."
Fallow,5.0,"I had an incredible dinner last night. I started with the gooseberry heat and the mushroom parfait, followed by the roasted miso aubergine and the rhubarb and custard spritz. I ended the meal with the British cheese board. I loved the inventive, delicious dishes and honestly had never imagined some of the flavors blending so well together. Rose was super attentive and all her recommendations were spot on! Thanks for a lovely evening."
Fallow,5.0,"Had the best Sunday roast at Fallow. The food was exceptional and what made our visit even better was their lovely bartender, Rosa, from Australia. She was so friendly and gracious and took the time to chat with us about living in London as I have just moved over from NZ. She even made an espresso martini shot for us at the end of our dinner because I had mentioned I was tired from a long day. Thank you, Rosa!!"
Fallow,5.0,"Fallow serves up fantastic food, with plenty of exciting dishes on the menu. I‚Äôd recommend skipping the burger ‚Äì I tried it and regretted it only because there were so many other more interesting options, and the burger itself wasn‚Äôt anything special.

The menu is designed for sharing, and I‚Äôd suggest ordering 2‚Äì4 small plates (plus sides get some veg in you) and 2 mains for a satisfying meal. Every other dish we tried was delicious and well worth it.

The dress code is relaxed ‚Äì casual is perfectly fine, and we didn‚Äôt feel out of place.

The staff were excellent, and our server, Amanda, was especially lovely, making the whole experience even better."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a great time here with my friends. The food is great and so do the cocktails. We love the mushroom parfait so much! It is definitely a mush have here. The waiter Josh C. was so helpful as well. Friendly reminder, do you reservation before you come."
Fallow,5.0,"We sat out on the terrace, which was lovely overall ‚Äì although there was a faint, odd odor that came and went, it wasn‚Äôt enough to spoil the experience. My partner had the beef Sunday roast and absolutely loved it. The potatoes were perfectly crispy, and the beef was cooked just right (always a gamble with roasts, but they nailed it here).  I, however, met my new obsession: the spicy tandoori cauliflower. Bold, smoky, and packed with flavor ‚Äì I‚Äôd come back just for that. 10/10 would recommend."
Fallow,5.0,"It was our first time here and we couldn‚Äôt decide if we wanted to have their set lunch or order a bunch of small eats.
Thank god for Alvin, we ordered one set lunch and a bunch of dishes to share and all of his recommendation were 10/10!
The beef ribs WERE INCREDIBLE and the mushroom parfait was so well balanced!"
Fallow,5.0,"Exceptional experience, Ive vyed after eating at Fallow for a long time, and the experience did not fall short whatsoever. Our host Anna was extremely attentive, informative and knowledgeable on drink pairings and answered all of our questions with ease.

Our intolerant guest was catered for to a T and our entire meal was sublime. You will not regret any meal at Fallow, please go if you have been meaning to!

Thank you to all the staff for a fabulous experience, I cannot wait to come back üòª"
Fallow,5.0,"The service was absolutely amazing, our waiter was so helpful with answering our queries and they were able to substitute items we couldn‚Äôt eat. We had the beef short rib, fillet and burger- all were great but the short rib and the sauce on the fillet were the best parts. Fries were also amazing. We came for a birthday and they provided some soft serve for us to share. Bill was around ¬£103 which is quite steep but good place to go for a special occasion"
Fallow,5.0,"I discovered this restaurant through their YouTube channel as I love watching their chef‚Äôs cooking demonstrations. I‚Äôve became mildly obsessed, and the day I arrived in London. I dropped my bag at the hotel and went straight here for lunch.

ÔøºWithout a reservation I only had a short wait, but I would advise booking in advance as it is no secret, how wonderful this place is.

I sat at the bar but I would recommend sitting at the chef counter, so you can watch all the activity in the kitchen. They also have outdoor seating which is covered and on the side street so still sunny and off the main drag.

The greatest challenge with dining solo is that you have to manage how much you order. Trying to be conservative I started with the Duck pancake, and I swear I could‚Äôve eaten six of these. They are so delicious light and fantastic. Ôøº

For my main, I ordered the Sandy black pork, which was juicy and sweet. I pretty much clean the plate and in an effort to get a little vegetable in my belly I ordered the Isle of White tomato salad.

Because I meal like this requires wine, I started with an Alvari√±o, and then shifted to a red selection from Greece, that was made by the bartender. I‚Äôm glad I tried the Greek wine, but I still stand firm in my opinion about Greek wines. Ôøº

If you were reading this review, and considering going I highly recommend it. I would suggest coming with friends, but she will still have a wonderful time, if dining alone."
Fallow,5.0,"Excellent food, and service. We had the tasting menu, and all of the dishes were extraordinary.
The service was very attentive. My food intolerances were met with alternatives, when communicated properly. One misunderstood regarding my food intolerance led to a free meal for my husband - which is, again, a sign of great service. The restaurant lives up to the hype. :)"
Fallow,5.0,"Worthy of its spot on the Michelin Guide and the best meal we had in London! JC was wonderful and gave us great recommendations. Here are some of my thoughts on the dishes we tried.

Mushroom parfait: I could have eaten so much more of this. Smooth, with an umami flavour and a subtle sweetness. Probably our favourite dish.

Burrata with chilli oil: An unusual combination, but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was! The mild, creamy flavour and texture of the burrata really complemented the distinct flavour and crunchiness of the crispy chili oil.

Bavette steak: Tender pieces of steak served with buttery tallow and an extremely rich, flavourful sauce.

Sweet corn with brown butter soft serve: The only thing I wasn‚Äôt completely crazy about, but that's really just a personal preference. Brown butter is a very mild flavour for ice cream and it just wasn't my cup of tea.

Chelsea tart: Every bite is of the most decadent caramel tart. It has a very slight bitterness that helps to balance the sweetness perfectly. We loved this one."
Fallow,5.0,"came here for a solo birthday dinner and the staff‚Äôs hospitality is top notch! had the oyster martini, mushroom parfait and cod head, ending off with the soft serve dessert. am full of good food by the end of the meal. such a great time. would like to come back and try the mussels next!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had an early pre-theatre dinner here at Fallow on Haymarket, and it was wonderful.  We ordered from the set menu with a couple of extra dishes on the side.

As extras to the set menu we ordered the beef short ribs and corn ribs as a little appetiser. The ribs were beautiful, the meat was flavoursome and so tender it just fell off the bone.  The corn ribs were something I'd not had before, I don't what the seasoning on them was but they were really tasty (I could have happily had just a glass of wine and a big dish of these!)

For our starters we ordered the burrata with caramelised onions and chilli and the mushroom parfait.  We ordered a portion of bread and butter to go with the starters but in hindsight this was a bit ambitious as the portion sizes were generous and I felt we didn't do the delicious crusty, warm bread justice.  The burrata was excellent quality, and worked really well with the onions and chilli.  The mushroom parfait was light and savoury, and served with generous amount of grilled bread.

For our mains we had the rolled lamb shoulder and the flamed mussels.  The lamb was tender and nicely cooked, served with crushed peas.  The mussels were cooked in a sriracha sauce, again, a generous portion.  I've not had mussels cooked in this kind of sauce before and they were absolutely delicious, there was a bread cro√ªte at the bottom of the dish which was an excellent way to soak up the last of the wonderful sauce (I may have used a spoon too...)

My friend chose the polenta cake with peach comp√¥te for her dessert and I opted for the sweetcorn and brown butter ice cream with smoked caramel.  I was curious as to how sweetcorn would work in a dessert and didn't quite know what to expect.  It was prepared almost like cornflakes and coated in a sweet crunchy caramel.  The ice cream was lovely too, I couldn't really taste anything smoky about the caramel but that might just be me.  The polenta cake was soaked in a syrup and the comp√¥te fresh and light.  We shared our desserts and polenta cake worked especially well with the ice cream.

The set menu is served until 5pm and is ¬£42 for 3 courses."
Fallow,4.0,"My feelings are mixed but leaning positive >

The service is phenomenal and it doesn‚Äôt seem forced. The staff seem to genuinely care and act like people, not machines programmed to serve which is a good representation of how the company treats them. Makes you feel happy.

The food is overall good and solely depends on personal preference. I came specifically for the corn ribs I‚Äôve heard much about. MUST GET!! I practically vacuumed them off the plate!! The portobello mushroom burger was nostalgic and exquisite ! Reminded me of my teenage years in Notting Hill. And all the desserts lived up to expectation.

The only negative I have was regarding the burrata- the seasoning tasted foul to both our taste buds, but hey I‚Äôm not an avid food connoisseur so what do we know. To your average person it tasted a little too salty and way too overstimulating.

They provided me a charger and it saved my life ! They take very good care of you"
Fallow,4.0,"We had a fabulous date night at Fallow. Four stars as I felt the price didn't quite match the food. Everything was packed full of flavour, perhaps even too much in some cases where I felt the flavour overpowered the produce (e.g. mussels).

We ordered the corn ribs, beef ribs, mushroom parfait, mussels, burger, ice cream and Chelsea tart. No regrets on what we ordered, but standouts were the mushroom parfait and the two desserts."
Fallow,4.0,"The food was delicious, but I didn't really like how the tables are laid out, as it felt like we were sat in a busy corridor with people brushing past constantly. Navigating a path to the bathrooms was also tricky. The service was very good but it would have been nice if the staff could have proactively made some suggestions on drinks pairings. I enjoyed it but I don't think I'd go back."
Fallow,5.0,Excellent visit asked for the discretionary charged to be removed. I prefer to tip in cash in London only higher denomination note I had was üí∂ so used that.  A visit I will repeat once again.  Perhaps one of the other sister restaurants.
Fallow,4.0,"This place truly shines when it comes to its small plates ‚Äî the Mushroom Parfait was so incredible we ended up ordering four of them, and the Corn Ribs were so addictive we had to get a second round. While the main dishes didn‚Äôt quite impress us the same way, the overall experience was still enjoyable. The ambiance is gorgeous and thoughtfully designed, making it a perfect spot for a laid-back yet stylish gathering. The staff were attentive, kind, and made us feel very welcome. A beautiful space with standout bites worth coming back for."
Fallow,5.0,Roast was delicious - best potato‚Äôs and gravy I‚Äôve had with a roast. Our server Ana was so kind and made the experience even better. I would really recommend here for the roast! Only negative I found was that my rump was slightly undercooked
Fallow,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in London and highly worth a trip. Everything about Fallow is great from their ethos around sustainable, local and seasoning cooking to the sites he hot sauce which you can buy (delicious). The food its self is delicious. Highly recommend the mushroom parfait, any of the burgers and beef ribs. Also don‚Äôt forget to save space for the deserts! The service is very attentive and the waiters are happy to answer any questions you have about the menu. If you are in London are looking for a restaurant with amazing food, atmosphere and decor then Fallow is the place to be."
Fallow,5.0,"Our time at Fallow was a good one, mainly because we were served by Alvin who was attentive and approachable providing good service. He also gave us a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary, which was very thoughtful of him and the restaurant.

We ordered corn ribs, duck pancake, mushroom parfait and cod head.

Standout dish was the mushroom parfait. Earthy and slightly sweet, great starter. The cod head was fun to dissect (revealed a lot more meat than expected), but you must have the patience to do so.

The prices are on the higher side, but that is expected with the level of skill and service provided. The vibe of the entire restaurant was also very inviting and lively, which makes it a great hangout spot."
Fallow,5.0,"Hip and vibrant, this restaurant delivers a modern take on British cuisine in a lively, buzzing atmosphere. It was absolutely packed on a Thursday night, so reservations are a must.

The concept is sharing plates, and every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and beautifully plated. The corn rib was the perfect start- crisp, salty, and seasoned with kombu to awaken the taste buds. The smoked beef ribs were another standout: fall-apart tender and glazed with a rich, flavorful sauce. Vegetarian options shone as well - the roasted miso aubergine and harissa cauliflower were incredible, layered with umami and topped with crunchy textures.

On our server‚Äôs recommendation, we finished with the Chelsea tart, and it did not disappoint. The custard was luxuriously smooth and slightly salty, perfectly balanced by the mild milk ice cream - a flawless end to the meal.

Service was warm, attentive, and highly accommodating. Overall, a must-visit for exceptional food, interesting plating, and an electric atmosphere."
Fallow,5.0,"It's a lovely cheat, as a warm welcome primes you to look for more things to appreciate. Impeccable service.
The parfait and beef ribs were out of this world.
The corn ribs were lovely, in particular with the lime juice.
The cod head was tasty, admittedly not living up to the rest but still absolutely no regrets.
A memorable experience living up to the YouTube hype."
Fallow,5.0,"If you‚Äôre in London and want a dining experience that blends creativity, bold flavors, and genuine hospitality ‚Äì FALLOW is an absolute must!

The Mushroom Parfait is silky and rich, the Smoked Beef Ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender with deep smoky notes, and the Burger is pure perfection ‚Äì juicy, flavorful, and served in a perfectly toasted bun. For something truly unique, try the Beef Tartare & Oysters ‚Äì a daring yet perfect combination of fresh brininess and rich beef.

But the star that sets FALLOW apart is their Smoked Cod‚Äôs Head ‚Äì beautifully presented, delicately smoked, and packed with flavor that will completely change the way you think about fish. It‚Äôs an absolute showstopper.

On top of all this, the staff make the experience unforgettable ‚Äì warm, attentive, and genuinely passionate about what they do. You‚Äôre not just having a meal here, you‚Äôre creating a memory.

Book ahead ‚Äì this is one of those places you‚Äôll want to revisit again."
Fallow,5.0,"One of the top 10 meals I‚Äôve ever eaten. Everything was immaculate from the service on down to the presentation. I let the chef choose my dinner which started out with the street corn, then mushroom p√¢t√©, which was possibly one of the best things I‚Äôve ever eaten. Next, I had the beef rib and the fried potato waffle. Finishing up the dinner with an incredible burger and fries. The sweet corn soft serve was a perfect dessert which was not too sweet, but had an incredible combination of textures. I know they‚Äôre listed in the Michelin guide, but in my opinion, they deserve a star."
Fallow,5.0,"Great experience, all staff interactions were friendly, professional, and full of personality. Erick, my server, went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect. The food was excellent, and eating facing the kitchen pure theatre. Would recommend for any occasion with plenty of choice to suit."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great time during our visit. Both the food and service were perfect from start to finish. I had really high expectations from following the restaurant on YouTube, recommendations from people like Ben at Sorted Food and your socials. All these expectations were exceeded.

Highly recommend the corn ribs, Sunday roast and the Chelsea tart.

Thanks a lot for a great meal"
Fallow,5.0,"The staff were super friendly and helpful with food recommendations, which made the experience feel welcoming right from the start. Service was impressively fast ‚Äî the dishes came out quickly without feeling rushed.

The mussels were a real highlight: fresh, tender, and swimming in a rich, buttery sauce that was perfect for dipping. Honestly, I‚Äôd go back just for that.
The corn ribs made for a fun, crunchy starter, and the beetroot salad was a surprisingly strong contender too ‚Äî the crispy seaweed on top added this brilliant textural contrast that made the dish pop.

The burger was a heavy-hitter: juicy, flavorful, and the blue cheese brought just the right amount of punch without overpowering the beef. Properly done.

The only miss? The drinks. Way too sweet ‚Äî like someone dropped a packet of candy into a cocktail shaker. Not a dealbreaker, but next time I‚Äôd probably skip them and stick to the food."
Fallow,5.0,"We had a great experience for dinner. The staff was very friendly! We got the ribeye and it was delicious, as well as the corn ribs. Some portion sizes were a bit small, but all of the food tasted great. They had warmers and blankets for outdoor seating as well.
Only downside is for the steaks, you do have to get a very large portion to share, they don't really have individual portions depending on the day."
Fallow,5.0,"Lunch at Fallow on Haymarket.

Really not sure why we haven‚Äôt been here before, however this place is awesome.

Fantastic food, some original dishes, all full of flavour. Couldn‚Äôt pick a favourite, all were consistently excellent.

Busy, buzzy, complimented with top, friendly service, with Joyce looking after us well. Sitting at the counter is the way to go.

Love their sustainability ethos too. With a set lunch menu of ¬£42 a head, this ticks all the boxes. Definitely worth a look.

Loved it. We will be back again soon, that‚Äôs for sure."
Fallow,5.0,"Had a really nice evening at Fallow a few weeks back. One of my colleagues recommended having dinner here, so I went.

Service was really good, kind staff, nice vibe, busy but not crowded and not overly loud.
Sat at the bar and had a cocktail first, great selection and made to order right in front of you.

For dinner we got the question if we‚Äôd like recommendations, which we welcomed. The food arrived about 20-25 minutes later. Started off with some bread and butter, some really good mushroom parfait and other dishes. I wasn‚Äôt blown away with everything, but nothing was disgusting or not up to par. Just‚Ä¶ not very special. That was until the dessert arrived. Best dish in a while. The burnt rice mouse and strawberry ice-cream was such a great combination that it really made me savor every bite.

Quality and price‚Ä¶ well I am a sous chef myself so I am more critical perhaps, but some of the dishes are regular to just plain. Could be elevated a bit. Especially for 42 pounds per plate.

Overall, the atmosphere, staff service and quality are really good. The place is hyped a bit so it is more expensive. ^^"
Fallow,5.0,"Our time at the Fallow was lovely, we had the Burrata, mushroom parfait, beetroot, focaccia, the lamb special and a side of cabbage. Everything was absolutely delicious! We followed this with the tart and espresso martinis, the addition of nutmeg was to die for! Service was amazing, Rosa really looked after us all night. We sat right next to the beautiful open kitchen and had wonderful brief conversations with chefs Elena and Archie, talking us through what and why they were doing everything. Had the most amazing night for our anniversary, will 100% be coming again!"
Fallow,5.0,"We had a wonderful dinner here, the service (especially Tomos) was spot on. The food was perfectly done and the quality was on point.
They even remembered that we were celebrating on that day so they brought us a little dessert to share.

They have many vegan options."
Fallow,3.0,"We started things off with their much-praised Mushroom Parfait -easily the highlight of the savory courses. Rich, smooth, and beautifully layered with umami from shiitake and lion‚Äôs mane, it fully lived up to the hype. 9/10 for flavour, balance, and originality.

Next came the Tandoori Cauliflower, which had great spice and char but was let down by excessive oiliness. I think the sauce would‚Äôve been better with a lighter base, maybe yogurt-based..something more creamy might‚Äôve worked better. The complimentary sourdough and butter were excellent, maybe would‚Äôve served with a sprinkle of flaky salt on the butter for that added attention to detail.

I had the Cod‚Äôs Head, which visually impresses and is clearly meant to showcase bold, sustainable cooking. The house-made sriracha sauce was the best part -delicious and punchy-but the cod itself, while well-cooked, was mostly gelatinous with very little meat, maybe I got a bad one?üòî The overall gelatinous texture was ultimately too off-putting for me, even though I‚Äôm generally comfortable with unusual dishes and preparations.

My wife went for the set lunch menu, which included a Bavette steak cooked perfectly medium-rare. The meat was excellent, and the gravy was rich and satisfying. However, one of the additional sauces tasted oddly artificial -reminiscent of powdered instant noodlesüò≤ - and didn‚Äôt sit well with an otherwise refined plate.

Dessert was the clear winner: the Chelsea Tart with Caramelised Whey. Decadent, rich, and perfectly executed, it was the kind of dessert that sticks with you‚Äîeasily the best part of the meal.

Service throughout was warm and polite, though not without issues. We had a 20-minute wait just to place our order, despite arriving for a 12:00pm booking right at opening, with the dining room still mostly empty. Our table was also wobbly, which required intervention from the staff. The waiter was helpful and quick to resolve it, but it‚Äôs one of those things that should really be spotted and fixed before service starts.

As for value, most dishes felt fair, especially on the set menu. But the ¬£20 cauliflower felt expensive‚Ä¶

Final Score: 7/10
‚Ä¢ üëç Highlights: Mushroom parfait, Chelsea tart, steak, friendly service
‚Ä¢ üëé Needs work: Sauce balance (cauliflower, steak), cod‚Äôs head texture, wait time and attention to detail with wobbly tables."
Fallow,5.0,"I found out about Fallow by word of mouth and started following on Instagram, I was fascinated by the videos showing how byproducts from other dishes were used for puddings, cocktails and other meals. We came here yesterday for a meal for my brother‚Äôs birthday and it did NOT disappoint.

Friendly and attentive service without being pushy, we were recommended drinks we might like but our lovely server also advised when she thought we were over ordering sides which was refreshingly honest and greatly appreciated. She also showed me pictures of her cat, which as a cat person really made my day! ‚ù§Ô∏è

The food was outstanding. Silky beef tartare with an oyster mayo, pork char siu with sesame crusted ribs which was exemplary, kombu seasoned fries and corn rubs, a tower of creamy sweetcorn soft serve dusted with crunchy corn nibs and a miso caramel corn flake crunch.  Despite the glam interior it was completely unpretentious and we were made to feel super welcome and comfortable. The brunch menu looks amazing and I honestly can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
Ave Mario,,Óóä
Ave Mario,4.0,"The food and service were wonderful, definitely living up to the great reviews I had read. The only reason I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars is the way the waiting was handled.

When we arrived, we put our name on the list and waited for about an hour. Only then were we told the only available table was outside (and it was too cold to sit there). If we wanted an indoor table, it would be another 30‚Äì45 minutes. Out of curiosity, I checked online and saw that I could immediately book a table directly ‚Äî which I did, and we were seated right away.

It would have been much better if the doorman had simply mentioned the option to book online from the start. It left us feeling a little misled after such a long wait.

That said, once we were seated, the food and service were excellent."
Ave Mario,5.0,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Ave Mario and it was fabulous! Service was exceptional and the ambiance was upscale casual with a touch of funky.  But the real star of the night was the food!  We had bruschetta, the Malfadine al Tartufo (pasta with truffles), and the Sex Bombette (pork loin stuffed with spinach)... and then topped it all off with chocolate mousse with hazelnuts and a cappuccino. Every dish had a unique blend of flavors that made them unlike anything I have had in the past... and all wonderful!  Highly recommend!"
Ave Mario,4.0,"Definitely an Italian restaurant to check out in London. I do recommend making a reservation. This restaurant was endless, and way bigger than expected. The vibes inside are unreal and it shows in their food quality and staff service. The water comes in a cool fish glass.

-crab pasta: 8/10, the flavors are amazing and the amount fed 2 people. however, do wish there was a bit more crab meat
-la gran carbonara: 10/10, presentation is everything and the fact is comes in such a little cute cheese wheel and is plated at the table made it more enjoyable. this dish is required for 2 people.
-truffle pasta: 10/10, who doesn‚Äôt love truffle. fed 1 person
-pink is punk pizza: 9/10, topped with mushroom, ricotta and prosciutto. shared by 2 people. very tasty and the toppings paired perfectly.
-espresso martini: just the way i loveee it. the perfect amount of foam, the right brownish/black color and topped with 3 beans
-house wine: 9/10"
Ave Mario,5.0,"My first time there and probably not my last. I love the decor/ambiance inside the restaurant. The rooms are split across various levels and it‚Äôs a lot bigger than it looks.

The food was really tasty. We each ordered a pasta dish and then shared a piece of fish and meat for the table. I ordered the pasta with crab and lobster bisque which was tasty but the real highlight for me was the T-bone steak. OMG it was so tasty. The meat literally melts in your mouth üòã.

Deserts didn‚Äôt disappoint either. We decided to share family style and ordered lemon cake, tiramisu and chocolate mousse. All of these were tasty.

Side note: Their toilets were so funky I had to take a picture!"
Ave Mario,5.0,"What an underrated gem!!! Easily missed but now one of my favourite places in the city. Will definitely come back again and bring more family and friends. You definitely need to have booked before hand. We came here for an anniversary dinner with my wife and were not disappointed. The food is authentic and extremely good. We had a carbs feast, starters, two different types of pasta - incredible - and then weshared a pizza - which was literally one of the best I ever had in twenty years of living in London! As it was our anniversary the staff very kindly decided to gift us a couple of drinks, however when we paid (you pay on your phone through a QR code linked to your table) I accidentally paid for those drinks too - but they insisted to refund them and give them to us for free. We were impressed by this honesty and kindness. The staff and management here know how to look after their customers! Not many places can boast that reputation - well done, and thank you!"
Ave Mario,4.0,"This place feels like a real Italian restaurant, with great design and a strong Italian vibe. The burrata (8/10) and the pizza (8.5/10) were the best parts. Everything else was good-fresh and authentic- but not outstanding. The lemon pie was interesting, with a tall layer of Italian meringue on top. Overall, it's a nice spot to visit."
Ave Mario,4.0,"Ave Maria in London has crafted a unique dining experience that merges contemporary elegance with a nod to classic Italian traditions. The concept revolves around simple yet high-quality ingredients, executed with precision to create dishes that delight the senses.

On my visit, I sampled two standout items: the burrata with truffles and the pizza Margherita with buffalo mozzarella. Both dishes showcased the restaurant's commitment to authentic flavors. The burrata was creamy and indulgent, perfectly complemented by the aromatic earthiness of truffles. The pizza Margherita was a masterclass in simplicity‚Äîeach bite brimming with the freshness of buffalo mozzarella and a vibrant tomato base.

The service was warm and friendly, leaving a positive impression. However, there was a noticeable wait before the dishes arrived, which, while slightly inconvenient, didn‚Äôt overshadow the overall experience.

Ave Maria is a must-visit for those seeking Italian cuisine that resonates with quality and care. A delightful haven for food enthusiasts."
Ave Mario,5.0,"Good vibes and the coolest toilet I've ever been but a bit trippy. Food was delicious and drinks were phenomenal.

Absolutely love the crockery too. Friendly staff. A bit on the expensive side but you're paying for the experience as well as the food and service. Where we were sat it was really light and airy as well, albeit individual seats were a bit narrow so could just about squeeze a bag and light jacket next to me"
Ave Mario,5.0,"Went here on August 16th to celebrate a 50th Birthday. It was very busy, but service and food were both excellent. Lovely place and much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. Very reasonably priced as well in my opinion."
Ave Mario,5.0,"We were seated right away, our waiter was very friendly, efficient and fun. The food was reasonably  priced and was very good. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, and my husband had the pasta with crab."
Speedboat Bar,,Óóä
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Speedboat Bar has nailed the basics - a concise one pager menu and food with fresh and bold flavours. I only ordered the Tom Yam Mama Noodles as a main and it was fantastic. The right amount of heat and depth of flavour until the last spoonful. Pork was crispy on the outside and tender. I also tried the crispy chicken skins. They were indeed very crispy and flavourful, making you want more. The pineapple pie with taro ice-cream was a fantastic end, crispy pastry and caramelised pineapple inside."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"We visited the Speedboat Bar and really enjoyed the experience. The atmosphere felt very authentic, both in terms of the food and the interior design. The service was friendly and welcoming, which added to the overall positive impression. We sat upstairs, which was a nice spot, though it was quite loud and made conversation a bit difficult. The menu offered good options, but the selection for vegetarians was somewhat limited. One thing to note: the Pad Krapao was extremely spicy ‚Äî so be prepared if you order it! Overall, a great place with authentic vibes and tasty food ‚Äì just be prepared for a lively, noisy setting."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Food and drinks were great!! I am obsessed with Tom yum mama noodles and regularly have the instant version at home so this boujee version was fantastic!! The fried rice was very flavoursome and even better with the sauces! Pour the beef tongue curry sauce on it and it‚Äôs even better! The pineapple pie was a nice way to end the meal
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The place looks like old bangkok which is lovely. The staff were friendly and attentive. I had the most awesome time eating, i think they have the best tom yum mama in town, it‚Äôs so rich and filling. Id definitely go back :)"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Food all overpriced and small portions
Ridiculous small size tom yum mama noodle price ¬£29 but it is just taste same as Thai brand mama instant noodles which you can buy around ¬£1.....the crispy pork in it is not crispy and meat is dry.   Morning glory is excellent, salad taste authentic. The invoice said there is OPTIONAL donation and OPTIONAL 13.5% service charge, but I dont see there is any option. Overall not nice experience."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"I had a great Sunday lunch here! The food was outstanding, bursting with authentic flavors.

The decor is fantastic‚Äîit really transported me to a local restaurant in Thailand. Upstairs, the bar has a cool retro vibe that I absolutely loved.

The food leans on the saltier side, but I didn‚Äôt mind since I paired it with their delicious green tea‚Äîsweet, milky, and just right. My only complaint is the price; they charge ¬£6 for the tea, which, with service charges, could probably get me ten of them in Thailand.

For starters, we had the pork belly‚Äîcrispy and packed with flavor‚Äîalong with a chicken salad that was tangy and had a fun crunch from the crispy bits. The fried rice was well-seasoned and far beyond your average dish. The beef tongue curry was tasty but a little too oily for my liking. Still, everything was incredibly satisfying!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"One of the most unique Thai restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. The food was super flavorful, a bit spicy but not unbearable and really well rounded. The tongue and tendon curry is what I had and it was amazing! Very tasty crispy pork as a snack, the chicken skins also were so tasty. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the sweet corn fritters which amazingly well with an ice cold draft Singha. Can‚Äôt forget to mention the margarita which was super unique and unlike any cocktail I‚Äôve ever had. Little bit spicy, not too sweet, not too sour and a good dosage of booze ;). Would recommend!!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Had to see what the hype was about and honestly I think it‚Äôs worth it!! Really amazing flavours and authentic to Thai roots. It‚Äôs London pricing of course so I‚Äôve seen some folks upset by the portion size for price, and I think that‚Äôs a valid criticism.

We had crispy pork to start, super delicious, melts in your mouth and the spicy sauce that comes on the side was awesome.

We also tried cellophane noodles with chicken, beef noodles and fried rice. Everything was spectacular flavour wise so I‚Äôd gladly go back!

It‚Äôs a small place so highly recommend making a reservation."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Really good food and friendly service. We ordered the chicken skins, corn fritters, fried rice and beef tongue and tendon curry. All were delicious and authentic. The atmosphere of this restaurant was great and almost like being transported to Thailand."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,More flash than substance. Some dishes were good while others like the cellophane noodles didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark (bland and lacked flavour). Was a bit pricey for what was served. Service was great - friendly and fast. The wine list was small and expensive. The cava was full of sediment and wasn‚Äôt great; you‚Äôre better off ordering wine or beer with your meal.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"One of those places that you stumble on and turns out to be absolutely fantastic.

The service was top notch, fast and efficient.

The Tom Yum noodles with crispy pork, prawns & squid is the best I‚Äôve ever tasted.

By far the best food I‚Äôve had this year."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Food was very yummy and hit the spot. We had a curry, fried fish, rice and crispy pork and it was the perfect amount for two people. The food was a bit overpriced but that‚Äôs London. Atmosphere was great but we came at 3 and it wasn‚Äôt very busy so I understand it may change when it hits 7"
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"I don‚Äôt really understand why this restaurant has such high ratings, the food is average, nothing particular amazing despite we ordered their most popular dishes. They are definitely overpriced for the portion.

The minced beef with holy basil was way too salty and overpowered the actual flavour of the ingredients, portion quite small and have to order rice separately.

Tom Yam noodles dish was very picturesque but it tasted exactly like the instant mama noodles shrimp flavour, except creamier and more sour. The exact same noodles as the instant noodles, given the price I felt ripped off. However I enjoyed the chunky pork bellies, prawns and meat balls, egg yolk, the toppings were my favourite. The ingredients don‚Äôt blend together though, felt like each ingredient was cooked separately. Using instant noodles in a dish is a big no for me, tasted too much like instant noodles I have all the time."
Speedboat Bar,1.0,"I had a poor experience at Speedboat Bar and would not recommend it. Despite the buzz around this venue, my visit left much to be desired in terms of food quality, service, and overall ambience.

Venue & Atmosphere:
The interior attempts to echo the feel of a lower-end Thai eatery, with dated d√©cor including a worn carpeted staircase and nostalgic photos of Thai street food stalls and the Thai monarchy. There are about 16 tables inside, with a few more outside and upstairs. The upstairs section has more seating, a bar, a pool table, and two unisex toilets. Tables are crammed closely together, and the lack of sound insulation means you‚Äôre clearly overhearing conversations from adjacent tables. The ambience is chaotic and uncomfortable‚Äîparticularly awkward as diners have to shift around when others leave due to space constraints. Best suited for a group of 4; smaller tables are impractical.

Drinks:
A decent selection of Thai beers like Singha and Leo, alongside some interesting cocktails and Thai iced coffee/tea. This was probably the highlight of the visit.

Food (Tasting Menu): Yaowarat Road Set Menu (¬£36pp)
Unfortunately, the food was a letdown across the board:
‚Ä¢ Chicken skin with Zaep seasoning: Overwhelmingly salty and spicy, with what tasted like a heavy dose of MSG. The skin was tough and the meat quality poor.
‚Ä¢ Chicken match with green mango: Unbalanced‚Äîcloyingly sweet and overly sour. The tamarind was overpowering.
‚Ä¢ Sweetcorn fritters: Extremely average and forgettable.
‚Ä¢ Stir-fried morning glory: Again, just average‚Äînothing stood out.
‚Ä¢ Minced beef with basil: Poor quality meat in an overpowering sauce.
‚Ä¢ Crispy pork curry: This dish had a vaguely sweet rendang-like sauce but was let down by fatty, low-quality pork belly. It was hard to find much actual meat.Large amounts were wasted due to the large amounts of  meat fat.

Value for Money:
The tasting menu came to ¬£72, but when pricing up the individual dishes, it amounted to about ¬£63. This wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if the food quality had been good‚Äîbut given the lack of balance in flavour, poor quality meat, no dessert included, and overall disappointing experience, it felt like poor value.

Service:
Service was indifferent. Dishes were dropped at the table without explanation, and staff seemed disengaged. When we raised concerns about the inedible chicken skin, we were told nothing could be substituted as it was a set menu. The manager simply reiterated this, showing no flexibility or empathy. There was no effort to remedy the situation.

Overall:
Below-average ambience, poor service, and subpar food with questionable meat quality and unbalanced flavours. Disappointing on almost every front. I‚Äôd advise avoiding this spot if you‚Äôre after a pleasant Thai dining experience in London."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Great food, staff were friendly and service was fast. Upstairs is mainly for drinks and has a pool table. Not sure if you have to pay to play, didn‚Äôt ask üôÇ
Anyways food was the most amazing Thai food. The shrimp ceviche was spicy and to die for."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Very tasty Thai food. Not a big menu, so you may not have a lot of choice though. I had a vegetarian curry and it was delicious. Very popular so reservation is advised."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Setup is authentic, gives you the Thai street food feel for sure but at a 10x higher price tag. Had their specialty tomyam noodle soup with pork, prawn, squid and meatballs which was very nice but definitely not worth ¬£29. Every one of their dishes essentially contain the same crispy pork belly, but just a variation of it.
Cocktail are OK and so was the service."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Good Thai and Asian dishes that you don't usually get elsewhere. The pineapple pie is to die for.

The bill became quite steep at lunch simply for 2, as portion sizes are quite small. The fried morning glory doesn't quite hit the spot and feels like it's missing a bit of seasoning - understandable though as they're catering for western palates.

Would definitely come back another time to try the beer tower!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Food tasted better than expected. Excellent taste! The staff were helpful and friendly.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Speedboat Bar, how much did I love thee? It was so good I came back twice on the same night. While London is so much better for foodies, the Asian flavours are still somewhat toned down and a little bland in several places. After a week in town, I was craving flavours that are more assertive and true to SE Asian cuisines and this place delivered in spades. My mouth was so happy!! The restaurant doesn‚Äôt have a spiciness scale so if you can‚Äôt handle lots of garlic and chilies, you may want to read the descriptions more carefully or ask the staff which dishes are less spicy.

All photos are dishes I ate in the restaurant - pork belly and prawn ceviche (first trip) and the sausage and mustard greens (second trip). Dishes I ordered to go are the phad see ew (which sadly I had to let go since I couldn‚Äôt keep it while watching a show even though I‚Äôm not planning on eating it) and the naem fried rice, which I ordered to go the second time I came back. Tip: If you get the mustard greens and the naem fried rice, pour the leftover sauce from the pickled greens on top of the fried rice. You‚Äôre welcome!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"SUCH a Cool place and great quality and authentic Thai food, decor transports you back to the 90s in Thailand. There‚Äôs free pool upstairs, it‚Äôs a whole vibe. The prawn ceviche was amazing (but on the spicier side) and the salted duck egg + anchovy option was wild but didn‚Äôt regret it! also got the Tom yum which is more pricey but could be shared between 2 people and highly recommend but it was the star of the show. Like wow. Cocktails and other drinks are delicious and decent options but maybe they could do a creamy pina colada option to cool my mouth after all those spices! But the ice tea did the trick x"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Very authentic, Thai experience in Central London.
Food was good but I guess it could have been a bit better. A bit too greasy for me.
I recommend sitting upstairs as the vibe is a bit better but overall entire place has nice, thai decor."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We were staying very close to this restaurant and were looking forward to dine here. The reservation seemed excessive but didn't want to take a chance. The restaurant itself is worth the hype. You are transported to Thailand food streets and in the most wonderful way. We tried a bunch of things and everything was top notch. Our favorite were the naemh fried rice, ooh delicious and the flat noodles, banging! Highly recommend to anyone in London looking for great food ."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"I was quite excited to try Speedboat Bar because of the positive reviews. The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty basic, service is okay nothing exceptional yet there is 13.5% service charge. The food is delicious, however the portions are so small for the amount of money you pay and it is safe to say you can leave the restaurant still feeling hungry. The experience overall felt like a rip off. What I found frustrating as well is that nowhere in the menu they have specified how spicy each dish is and you may end up ordering something that you cannot eat just because of how hot it is."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"At the time of writing, this is probably the best Thai food that I have had in London. The restaurant itself does feel like you could be in Bangkok, down to the Muay Thai fights being shown on the televisions. The food was all excellent, perfectly balanced between spicy, sweet and sour. We tried the chicken skins (something I am amazed has not become more popular in the UK), crispy pork, mustard greens with Chinese sausage (which was maybe a rogue choice but may have been my favourite dish), beef tongue curry, pad krapao (with a fried egg, of course), and morning glory. Will definitely be back."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Just one of the very best thai meals I had in London. Hands down.
Went with my missus for our anniversary and we were mesmerized. Can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Honest prices and great service as well, can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"We were asked if we were done 3 times by the staff whilst staying there for about an hour. Visibly we had food left on the plates and were still eating. There were 3 empty tables around us. I got the impression that they wanted us to leave quickly.
Had Tom yum, chicken with green mango kerabu, Tom yum noodles and fried fish fillet. Chicken and fish were both really salty and needed hefty rice to eat with, but generally flavourful."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Love Plaza Khao Gaeng so when I heard this place was run by the same people I had to visit.

Fantastic! Everything we ordered was bursting with flavor. Highly recommend coming here if you like Thai food."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Amazing! One of the best Thai places I‚Äôve been in London. Every dish was so tasty. If you‚Äôre not afraid of some offal I highly recommend the beef tongue and tendons, super fatty and delicious. The crispy chicken skins are also a must to start!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Food was fantastic, incredibly tasty. The atmosphere made you feel like you were right in the heart of Bangkok. I would highly recommend a visit."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Speed Boat Bar, Chinatown London
I've got high hopes and am really looking forward to this place! There are a lot of choices around Chinatown, but I wanted to give it a try!
They were fully booked and seemed very popular but, given my name on the waiting list, it took 30 mins as they turned table very quickly. It has great vibes in the seating area downstairs. It's a complex menu and reasonably priced if compared in London. We didn't drink alcohol but tried Thai Tea, which was okay. They looked nice but nothing special. The food was good, but some of the dishes had too much spice and way too salty! I didn't like the pork snack at all. The taste was weird (it is much better without the sour taste!!) Tomyum noodles in the hotpot (¬£29) looked fantastic but a little too much spice in them! But the ingredients were top quality! The bill was ¬£100 which is usually the price of 2 anyway. Very good and friendly service. Hopefully I will be back for cocktails and shots with Minced Beef With Holy Basil and rice. Check it out if you're in this area! Thank you."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,A very authentic Thai experience here in London. The waitress was amazing and we really did enjoy our food which was a tounge curry(pretty spicy) and a fried rice. Would eat here again when back in London.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Lives up to the hype. Incredible food, we loved everything we ate. To balance the spice get the Jelly Bia cocktail (it was surprisingly so tasty!) we dangerously could‚Äôve eat an entire bag of the crispy chicken skins lol. We loved the Tom Yum soup w squid prawns and giant slices of crispy pork belly. YUM!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Food: The food was tasty, but we were a bit disappointed with the small portion sizes.

Service: The staff were friendly, but there wasn‚Äôt much service beyond taking our order and bringing water/bill. They didn‚Äôt come to check if the food was okay etc.

Price: Considering the small portions and minimal service, we found the prices to be quite overpriced. On top of that, a 13.5% service charge was added to the bill (higher than the normal 12.5% service charge in London), along with a ¬£1 charity donation‚Äîsomething we hadn‚Äôt encountered before in London and elsewhere.

Atmosphere: The decor is very Thai-inspired, and the space appears to have been converted from an English pub. There‚Äôs even a pool table upstairs, which is quite interesting. Most of the customers were Westerners; we barely saw any East Asian diners - the above probably explains why."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"Having lived in Thailand for around 20 years, we were very disappointed in the food.

It wasn‚Äôt bad, but it really didn‚Äôt taste authentic. The flavours were just not right.

Find it hard to believe that it was made by Thai people.

Service was professional and friendly."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Service was good and efficient however I wasn‚Äôt blown away from the food. We ordered chicken skins however they were very spicy to the point it ruined our mains, we weren‚Äôt even informed that they were spicy on the menu. The main courses were just average in my opinion, I did like the pad see ew, the Thai tea that we ordered tasted watery. Overall disappointing and pricey, not really authentically Thai. Would not return."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"The restaurant offers pretty typical Thai food and it tastes good. However, the menu is quite small and the portions are not very big. The wait time for a table is ~10 mins and the average price per head is ¬£26/person without a drink."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Excellent authentic Thai food that doesn't pull its punches when it comes to spice (be warned). The cocktails were very good as well.

My only gripe was that it was quite expensive for what it is - maybe I'm spoiled by my local Thai eatery but this place was almost twice the price (although I suppose there is a Soho premium).

All in all, very worthwhile a visit."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Best Thai place in London. Avoid if you cannot handle your spice as they are not joking. The cocktails are also very nice and the Thai ice tea is a 10/10. Also, make sure to order the Chicken Skin as appetiser."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Service was quick and attentive, and the atmosphere felt relaxed, almost like a casual caf√©. We ordered chicken skin, morning glory, beef tongue curry, crispy pork curry, and a noodle dish. I can‚Äôt say it felt completely authentic, but everything was tasty enough that we finished it all.

I do agree with some of the earlier comments about the food being on the salty side and the portions feeling a little small for the price. Overall, I‚Äôm glad we gave it a try, but I think I‚Äôd lean towards local spots that haven‚Äôt been so heavily reviewed and hyped by London food critics."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"This is my second visit to this restaurant, and I still love the ambiance because it feels just like being in Thailand. They offer beer towers and authentic Thai dishes that are delicious and packed with strong flavors, but the portions are quite small for the price. It‚Äôs on the expensive side, but it‚Äôs fine for occasional visits. I recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for an authentic Thai food."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Thought this was 'good' but not 'great'. Good: because the food was generally tasty, reasonable value, good atmosphere. But missed out on being 'great' as a lot of the dishes were fairly simple and not massively innovative - e.g. minced beef with spices and a fried egg. I thought the fried chicken skins, which people rave about, just tasted like pork scratchings.

The cocktails were great though, other than the negroni which wasn't especially different to a normal negroni.

I see a lot of reviews worry about levels of spice. I thought it was fine (as a Brit!) although the curry was definitely at the upper end of my tolerance level.

Unusually I thought the dessert was the best course and I would definitely recommend the taro ice cream option."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,I recently visited with a partner the restaurant for a dinner. I booked a table ahead of time as tables go quickly. A big downside for me was the layout of the tables where basically you are sharing your table with some strangers ( who actually came in sick). All of the dishes were tasty however I found that some of the dishes had too much of spice. It would be great if the menu adopted a scale of spiciness. The biggest highlight of this restaurant is the superb dessert with taro ice cream. I will surely return here only to enjoy that delicious dessert!
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Most impressive crispy pork ever‚Ä¶!! It is first slow cooked then the skin is made crispy‚Ä¶ fine dining level of preparation. Crispy skin with melt-in-your-mouth experience.
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Really enjoyed it. My third time here and London heatwave made me think I could almost be in Thailand! Service was good and friendly. Food was good although I thought the beef stir-fry was quite salty (and I like my salt) and the fish over cooked. I know it was deep fried but wonder whether it was reheated - it was very crunchy. The aubergine was my favourite and I really liked the prawn 'ceviche'. Will definitely return. Love the atmosphere and spice levels!
Speedboat Bar,1.0,"We had:
Beef tongue curry: not much flavour other than a tinge of curry taste, one-dimensional taste and nothing interesting about it, meat was 60% fats
Morning glory: super sweet and salty
Crispy pork: perhaps the only saving grace but still pretty average
Crispy chicken skin: very salty
Rice: dry

Portions were very small, food came very cold and we waited more than 30ish mins for the food. Appreciate the staff who found us a table despite visiting with no reservation. Atmosphere was not that bad, interesting deco but we were seated on the same table as the couple who were constantly making out lol. Hence, overall a very unpleasant and disturbing experience for us."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Amazing varied dishes with a good kick to them! Place is packed and you can see why! gluten free options are available but not all dishes
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Loved the food here, specially the tom yum but also the place is designed and curated to perfection to remind you of a local Bangkok bar - great lighting, attention to all details, every corner will remind you of Bangkok"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"everything we ordered was amazing! The restaurant was full of people, it was a fun, loose atmosphere, we really enjoyed ut and would absolutely visit again!"
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"Overhyped restaurant which I‚Äôm unsure how it‚Äôs sustaining its rating.

We tried the ‚Äúset menu‚Äù which was shockingly bad. The chicken skins, as others mentioned, were served cold and can easily chip a tooth. Out of the food that comes with the set menu 3/5 are intensely spicy with no ability of the restaurant to module the heat. We ordered a Tom Yam on the side which was one of the only things we could eat‚Ä¶

Cocktails were average, service was average, and overall not value for money if you look at the price tag. I would not recommend this restaurant."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"An amazing find. I realize its a popular place. Went there with friends and tried a whole variety of dishes. Every dish was special and tasted amazing. Highly recommend going there.
For a fun citrus drink, definitely try the calamansi drink."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Enjoyed the food, but the portion sizes didn‚Äôt quite justify the price."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Service is nothing short of incredible.   We arrived an hour early and took a chance to ask if we could move our slot in which they obliged without issue. Most restaurants tend to rush you with ordering and getting out, not here, the waitress took time to help choose and explain the cocktails and suggestions on food.
Fish balls, chicken skins and the noodles were absolutely amazing and will be back for those again.
I do love a good holy basil stir fry, and would say this was the only dish that was a slight let down on taste.  Other than that 10/10."
Speedboat Bar,3.0,"I was surprised that all the dishes were smaller than I expected.
In the country where I live, I‚Äôve never seen such small portions at a restaurant"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We absolutely loved the food here. There are lots of vegan options, just make sure you ask for the vegetarian menu when you arrive!

The pickled mustard green salad, sweet corn fritters and potato and gourd curry are not to be missed. A great combo together.

Yum!

Portion size is not huge.

Atmosphere is cool, trying to be authentic."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The chicken matches & mango and the pickled mustard greens salad are very delicious! I liked the corn fritters, the minced meat, and the potato curry. The tendon curry and the aubergine were a bit bland for my taste. All the dishes go well together and it is definitely a memorable meal. Lovely music and a fun atmosphere and the service is very friendly. But make sure you ask for the vegetarian menu because even though we expressed interest in trying different dishes that didn‚Äôt have pork, we weren‚Äôt told that we could have some of the dishes without it (such as the pickled mustard greens) until we‚Äôve ordered most of our food and even then we weren‚Äôt given a vegetarian menu to look at. So I would recommend you ask for both menus before placing your order. All in all, I would highly recommend this place!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We came to Speedboat Bar on a whim quite early‚Äîaround 5 pm‚Äîand managed to get a seat. The decor is styled like a fast-food bar in Bangkok, and while the colourful and slightly tacky-looking menu and design may seem basic at first glance, they are, in fact, well crafted in that style (if you have a design eye!). The menu feels authentic (to a Brit like me who's only visited Bangkok once!) and refreshingly different from what you might expect at typical Thai restaurants in London (don't expect a Green Curry on the menu!). That‚Äôs what makes it special‚Äîeverything feels both interesting and familiar. We ordered a variety of dishes, as you can see, ranging from fried rice to beef noodles and crispy pork. Every dish was fantastic, with a great balance of spice and flavour‚Äîsome of the best Thai food I‚Äôve had in London with the flavour. The prices are expected for the central location, and the portion sizes are good. The beer selection is pretty much all Singha brand, which are typically pretty light later pairs well with the food. Drinks are available by the bottle, half pint, or tower, alongside some interesting cocktails - although they didn't have the Negroni available. Visit Speedboat Bar if you‚Äôre after fantastic food in a fun, unpretentious setting."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Yummy food! But not life changing. More like a 4.5 but Google doesn‚Äôt support that.

The steamed aubergine was actually our favourite. The beef tongue curry was a little chewy, but I enjoyed the tendons! Our fried eggs were cold which was sad. The sweetcorn fritters were good but not life changing. Some were a bit expensive

Really enjoyed the taro ice cream, although the pineapple pie was okay

Overall think I enjoyed plaza khao gheng for food a little more.
Service was really lovely!
Tables were pretty squished"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Finally got to try this place after all the hype and recommendations. I have to say, the food options (way more interesting and exciting than your average high street Thai restaurant or takeaway) were varied and modern and the quality was superb. I'll be coming back with some friends in the near future.

The morning glory was the best I've had outside of Thailand and the black pepper sea bream was original and so tasty. Everything did have a spicy kick to it, but it made it authentic! The restaurant has a cool vibe and feels a bit like being in Thailand with the cutlery they use, the stainless steel tables, the pictures of the Royal Family on the walls etc. I'd say it's definitely a casual atmosphere and more of a cafe vibe than restaurant, which is why it feels authentically Thai.

Service from our main waitress was very good, she was friendly and polite. They also let us add one extra person to the booking on arrival.... which was much appreciated.

My only negative comment is the portion sizes! Some of them are so small we had to order double after tucking into our mains. I guess that is why the quality is so good as they are tight with the dish sizes...

Bill came to ¬£117 including service for 3 adults for lunch, without alcohol or starters. Just loads of mains and sides."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,We were recommended this Thai place during our last visit to London and thought we must try. Note you need to make a reservation well in advance. I made mine 3 weeks in advanced just to be sure. I think the outdoor seating is first come first serve however but that‚Äôs risky in London when it can rain all of a sudden. The staff are very friendly and explained the whole menu to us. I just wish they were a bit more honest on the spiciness of the food. We ordered some of the curries and were told that it was mild. They were very spicy and quite uncomfortable to eat. Other than the spice though they were delicious and tasted very authentic and similar to food I had when visiting Thailand a couple of years ago. I highly recommend to anyone who loved Thai and can handle spicy food. I‚Äôd avoid the alcoholic cocktails as they were quite watered down and not the greatest. Best to stick with a nice Thai beer or water! Enjoy!
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"An absolute surprise to find such amazing tasting Thai food in a ""Bar""

Highly recommend this place for Thai food but he warned the spice levels are high.

The aubergine was delicious and so was the prawn ceviche.

Don't forget to order the corn fritters for starters and the rice noodles with prawn and the beans ü•∞"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Got a table for lunch on a rainy Sunday afternoon without a reservation- be warned it is a busy popular place and we have failed to eat here before sans reservation.
Great food and atmosphere. Quirky uniforms for the servers. Service is quick, friendly and efficient.
We shared the absolutely delicious chicken matches with green mango kerabu. And will order it again. The portion looks small but it packs a punch and can easily be shared by 2 if you are ordering more food. The crispy egg noodles, gravy, pork , prawns and squid was underwhelming- the gravy was not ‚ÄòThai‚Äô enough- almost western, dare I say and we were probably expecting something tangy and exciting. Still, we asked for and got some birds eye chilli which definitely made an improvement. Crispy pork and black pepper with a rice side lived up to expectations. The food was delicious and different from anything one usually gets in a Thai restaurant. Giving it a 4 * only because the noodles did not live up to our expectations. But will be back to try other things in the menu."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,Second visit and reminded us of why we couldn't wait to come back. All of the dishes are so tasty and packed full of flavours.
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Wasn't too bad for a first visit. No frills and you will come out smelling of the kitchen goodness you were steeped in hehe. We were sat downstairs in the main restaurant in a cosy corner. We had a milk tea and a cocktail with the sweetcorn fritters to get going and they were OK. Cocktail felt watered down though - can't remember the name but it had guava in it which is why I chose it. Sweetcorn fritters a touch oily but not off-puttingly so. Mains were the special Maggie mee pot and we also had the whole dry curry sea bream. These were fair. Not crazy delicious, i have to say but filled a gap. The instant noodles dish (i say as an asian who loves instant noodles lol) was big and I struggled to finish it actually possibly due to the tom yum soup being the creamy one rather than the lighter broth one. Taro ice cream was nice as was the pineapple tart it came with.

FYI The bathrooms are upstairs and there are only two unisex to use which you will definitely need to really push the doors hard to check if they are in use otherwise you will be politely waiting for ages lol the restaurant should do something to make it easier or more visible to see whether they are in use or not. It was mentioned our booking was for a birthday, but there was no acknowledgement of this so I wonder what's the point of having this feature in the booking process."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"An overhyped restaurant that is overpriced with average food, average service and average decor. You‚Äôd go once and never return.

The chicken skins were small portion and shockingly cold when they arrived. I asked and they told me, it was cooked previously and served cold. So I sent it back. Cold chicken skin - unbelievable.

The corn fritters were hot and freshly made but bland. Good portion but the chilli sauce was straight from a bottle. Not worth ¬£8.

The glass noodles (vermicelli) were nice but tiny portion with so little chicken. Not worth the ¬£14 price.

Half a pint of Singha was quite pricey.

Toilet was shocking and seat was broken.

Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Avoid"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"First of all, the service is slow. Food is great for most dishes, we recommend crispy pork and the fish fillet.
The mama noodle was a disaster, it‚Äôs something that we can definitely make at home with few simple ingredients, and the dish was 30 üí∑, and it wasn‚Äôt even good lol.

The worst part if the bill, they included donation money which we had no clue about. I found out when looking at the bills and did request to took it off.
Would we go back? No
Do we recommend? No"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"The flavour is fabulous! Not too salty or sweet, it's just right! The fish is perfectly fried and the curry is creamy. My friend like the corn fritters a lot. I like the fish! The rest are nice too. I will definitely be back! Please make a reservation! Always full!

Speedboat Bar,4.0,"Very tasty authentic Thai food! I needed a place for lunch before going to the show Les Miserables and found this Thai place so I walked in with no booking.
I  had some Pad See Ew beef and a whiskey ice for lunch. The fried noodles tasted super good and the beef was very tender! I love my meal but I think it's slightly small in portion for the price.
The staff was friendly!"
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Unfortunately I'm updating my review and downgrading it to a 2 out of 5. The Tom Yum that had impressed me so much on my previous visit was disappointing. The balance was not ok and it was extremely sour (of course it needs to be sour but this was too much. It was not pleasant to eat). The egg yolk did not turn the broth into the silky one I remembered. Service was also not great. It took ages to get the order and to get the bill. Such a disappointment. I used to adore this place.

Old review
No doubt that this was the best Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand. Every single dish was absolutely delicious. They all had different levels of heat but in no case the heat covered any of the other flavours. My mouth and lips were tingling when I left the place. The best dish by miles was the Tom Yum soup. Completely different to any other Tom Yum I've ever had before. The creaminess that the egg yolk added completely changed the broth. It was scrumptious. Can't wait to go back again"
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"We really enjoyed the food. The crispy pork curry was delicious and had just the right amount of heat and the Naem fried rice was one of the best fried rice I‚Äôve ever had - just such great wok flavours. Sadly, the service didn‚Äôt match the food. We started off with a Chinese girl who was very pleasant and friendly but then there seemed to be a change of shift and she disappeared and a couple of young guys started serving our table. The service was very robotic or like a couple of students who had just been told what to do with no attempt to connect with the customer. Or perhaps it‚Äôs the 12.5% service charge and they don‚Äôt care as they know they will get some tips.
They also charged us 50p for some extra fish sauce. I‚Äôd understand if it was a home-made sauce but it comes from a mass-produced bottle and is probably something that most customers don‚Äôt touch and gets thrown away all the time.
Great food but improve the service and this place is a 5 star."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"A really cool themed Thai restaurant!! The inside of the restaurant was decorated in a very interesting way, it gave the place a great atmosphere and a relaxing feeling. The service was good nothing to complain about.
We loved the cool names and dishes on both the drinks and food menu. The only thing I would definitely say to watch out for is the spicy warnings on the menu, they are incredibly hot and not for the faint hearted."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Great food, great drinks and friendly staff. Best Thai food in China Town!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Okay here‚Äôs must order at this place from a Thai food huge fan - Tong yum mama noodles, minced pork/beef rice with a fried egg, stir fried morning glory.

Super nice, the minced meat would be spicy but smells too good, I just couldn‚Äôt resist‚Ä¶"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Sensational. Scrumptious. Surprising. Satisfying. Speedboat.
I‚Äôve wanted to try Speedboat Bar for ages, and it absolutely delivered.

We dropped in after a day of shopping in London‚Äîme, my wife, and our son Thomas‚Äîand luckily managed to get a table without a booking. The staff were friendly and welcoming from the moment we walked in.

We started with corn fritters and crispy pork‚Äîboth full of flavour, crispy, and seriously addictive. But it was the mains that blew us away: naem fried rice, minced beef with holy basil, cellophane noodles with chicken, and crispy pork in black pepper sauce. Every dish was a total knockout. My son looked like he was about to lick the plate clean (and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed him).

Dessert? Pineapple pie with taro ice cream and mango pudding with red pomelo‚Äîboth were next-level good.

Massive shoutout to Abigail, whose service made the meal even more special. Speedboat Bar was well worth the wait, and we‚Äôll definitely be back‚Äîwith a reservation and an empty stomach."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"We went for a birthday celebration and left very satisfied. We were recommended two dishes by a fellow diner and they did not disappoint. The food was incredibly tasty, and the wait staff advised which ones were quite spicy which was a good warning. Every dish we ordered was packed with a flavoursome punch, the cocktails were delicious and the Leo Lager was the perfect drink!
We ordered the sweetcorn fritters and prawn civiche for starters. Both were delicious but the prawns were super spicy, we were advised to remove the fresh chilly on top if we didn't want them to be too hot (I did but my partner consumed them all!)
We also ordered the Morning Glory (incredible flavours) the Mince Beef (packs a punch of spice, delicious) the crispy pork (delicious but could have been crispier) and the wide noodles (my favourite!)
Finished off sharing the pineapple pie which was perfect.
The staff were all lovely and welcoming, and quick the take our order.
Spent ¬£150 for 2 with alcohol which I thought was very reasonable!
Delightful restaurant and will definitely be back!"
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Total funky awesomeness, this restaurant revisits Thai classics in a more modern and (well funky) way, leaving plenty of room for delicious food discoveries!
While it's a fun place, the food is serious-sly outrageously good, with fresh and bold flavours and interesting pairings.
The place, the concept, the decor, the menu, the service, I loved it all! Food is out of this world, I definitely recommend this place."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Friendly, efficient service and the food was absolutely outstanding. My partner and I had a rare opportunity to have a meal out (we don‚Äôt get much time out together since having a kid!) and Speedboat bar did not disappoint.

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how great all the food was - the flavour, intense zesty zinginess and overall execution was fantastic and exactly what I was hoping for.

Everything was tasty but my highlights were the prawn ceviche and pineapple pie with taro ice cream.

I was very impressed and hope to come back soon."
Speedboat Bar,4.0,"I had a birthday dinner celebration here with my best friend. I booked ahead of time but the table they gave us was a shared table with two other people. When I asked to be moved, they moved us to a better table but all the tables were really closer to each other. I could hear people near us were talking about. I guess that‚Äôs concept, as it‚Äôs supposed to emulate Thai eateries.

The food was good. We thoroughly enjoyed the corn fritters and chicken chicken matches. The minced beef with basil and chillies went well with the steamed rice but we liked the stone pepper sea bass the most.

The cocktails were good too, though on the pricey side. My fave was the jelly bia. So refreshing. The 7-eleven pineapple pie with taro ice cream was out of this world. Overall, a great experience."
Speedboat Bar,5.0,"Have heard about this Thai restaurant for a while. We visited in a Saturday afternoon without reservation. The receptionist had took our telephone number and called when a table was available. 30min waiting time which I think was reasonable.

Service was very attentive. The waiter came to us several times asking for our feedback on the food.

We had the prawn ceviche, beef tongue curry, tom yam mama noodles, fried rice and the beef flat rice noodles. Beef tongue melt in your mouth. The tom yam noodles was a bit expensive but there were quite a lot of ingredients: crispy pork, meat balls, prawns, etc. The soup base was creamy and mild (not too hot and sour). Prawn ceviche might be a bit too hot & spicy for the locals but we loved that.

All dishes were very delicious except the portion was a bit small, but we understood this is Central London. It is so hard to find a cosy place that offers Thai raw prawn dish in London.

Definitely will visit again."
Speedboat Bar,2.0,"Disappointed confused and beginning to question the value of google ratings. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong and all the hype surrounding this place is right??

We found disinterested staff. Mucky toilets. Shabby decor (yes I guess they‚Äôre trying to achieve a distressed Deerhunter backdrop on a shoestring). And utterly utterly mediocre food. The noodle dish was a catastrophe. The fried rice would have Uncle Roger waking up in a cold sweat. The mama Tom Yam was decent but was effectively something I could make at home with a couple of packets of Mama creamy Tom Yam noodles. There is nothing positive here and in a city replete with authentic Thai options you should not come here.

Would I come back? No.
Would I recommend you try this place to make up your own mind? Only if I hated you."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,,Óóä
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The food was outstanding. Venison was extra tender and was just melting in mouth - definitely recommend this dish. Cooked to the perfection. Get it together with the broccoli salad which was crunchy and flavourful too. Octopuses weren't my personal choice so I can't speak of its preparation but my partner did enjoy them very much so they must have been delicious too!
To my taste, the deserts, despite served in a unique way, didn't steal the show that evening. We did like them though as they weren't overly sweet and the texture was perfect.
Atmosphere was perfect - quiet and serene - and the waiter who served us was able to help us select dishes and articulated the details of each dish very clearly."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,We enjoyed a set course pre-theatre meal. Our server Lana along with her colleagues were fabulous. Our dinner was wonderful and we highly recommend The Restaurant at St Martins Lane.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic lunch on their new summer menu. I was looked after Monika which I have to say was fantastic host that greeted me with a smile and carried it till the end. And the seabass, omg it was the highlight cooked to perfection!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Lovely experience of dining at the Restaurant at St Martins Lane. The staff was excellent. We chose the pre-theater meal. Food was delicious as well. The whole setting of the restaurant was quite interesting. It's a perfect place to dine before watching any west end shows in my opinion.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our Valentine's date at this restaurant, and it was an unforgettable dining experience. From the moment we stepped inside, the cozy and welcoming ambiance enveloped us, setting the stage for a truly romantic evening.

The menu was nothing short of impressive, offering a delightful variety of dishes that seemed to cater to our every craving. Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece, showcasing a brilliant combination of ingredients that danced together perfectly on the palate. The flavors were rich, sophisticated, and beautifully balanced, reflecting the high level of culinary expertise behind their creation.

Not to be overlooked, the drinks selection was extensive, featuring everything from classic cocktails to non alcoholic beverages, ensuring the perfect pairing for every course of our meal. The attentive staff recommended excellent choices that complemented our meals exquisitely.

In every aspect, this place delivered a luxurious dining experience that made our Valentine's celebration truly special. The care and detail put into every aspect of our visit were evident, making it a place we would highly recommend to anyone looking to create memorable moments over exceptional food and drink."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Went for a bottomless brunch. Food was off-the-scale delicious! Drink chosen to be bottomless was fab, and not watered down. Great brunch location."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"I ordered the theatre menu.
The food was good and everything was well made, the produce was fresh and high quality. But it lacked layers in texture and flavor. So even though everything was well prepared it still tasted a bit flat.
But all in all I had a good dining experience and the staff was very friendly, especially Juliana and Yvette."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"This was a surprising find, and a perfect pre-theater dinner spot. Although restaurants in a hotel are not always great, my friend and I really enjoyed their two-course dinner before running off to the theater. The pre-theater menu lasts till 7pm and it wasn‚Äôt crowded on a week night. Octopus salad and cod fish were cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were delish! Service from the rest of the staff was spotty but our server who spoke Spanish was very good and he was funny."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"From the moment we arrived, the service was absolutely impeccable. Every detail was looked after with care, professionalism, and genuine warmth. The atmosphere was lively yet relaxed, making it the perfect setting for a wonderful meal.

A special mention must go to Skender, who truly went above and beyond to make our experience exceptional. Skender was attentive without being intrusive, incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and had a natural friendliness that made us feel completely at home. He made excellent recommendations and made sure we were looked after at every step.

It‚Äôs rare to find service that feels both five-star and genuinely heartfelt ‚Äî Skender delivered exactly that. He is a true credit to the team at The Restaurant.

Thank you for an outstanding experience ‚Äî we will definitely be back"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Our experience at St Matins Lane restaurant was fabulous. Monika was especially cheerful and helpful. We had the breakfast buffet attached to our room‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I would have to say was the best breakfast buffet I have ever had at any hotel anywhere. Food was fresh and whole, not the cheap premix foods that are so often seen."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Amazing evening , surprise ‚Ä¶ our waiter was so attentive and kind . The food was beuon expectations. The dishes were amazingly delicious and presented like piece of art . This place is simply fabulous. The desserts were stunning"

Or head to the bar after too!
Definitely recommend! coming back again soon! Thank you!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"It was our last night in London and we found this place with high ratings on Google. We got a main dish of ox cheek waygu and it was okay, not juicy, had a bone marrow sauce and was topped with more beef? The potatoes had no flavor. The sauce was gross but thought maybe it‚Äôs an acquired taste. We decided to try two desserts figuring no dessert is bad. Boy were we wrong. Both deserts the Black Forest and blackberry tart were absolutely disgusting. I‚Äôm not sure if something in it was off but the Black Forest was a strange consistency with no flavor and the blueberry tart had no hint of blueberry at all and instead tasted salty and nearly inedible. My husband who is too polite to say anything ate it all. We left and did not say anything, but it was the worst meal we have had in our life and came in at a super high price. I would avoid this restaurant at all costs. Wish we said something and saved $50 on the desserts."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Lovely place with a simple fixed price pre-theater menu and small Michelin star portions. Service was very well-coordinated and friendly. The dining room was too dimly lit and unfortunately quite empty at 6pm on Easter Sunday. I hope they are more busy and successful on other days. Overall a good balance of quality and price but the a la carte menu is probably too expensive for most
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,3.0,"The restaurant is at the ground floor of the hotel‚Äôs lobby. Nice interior and ambience. Staffs are friendly and service was fantastic.

Ordered the pre-theatre menu via Timeout. We paid ¬£30pp for 3 courses including a glass of house wine.

Had the octopus for starters, pan seared cod for mains and pear tart for dessert. Pear tart was quite good, the rest were ok.

Great place to catch up with friends in a less noisy setting. We also didn‚Äôt feel rushed to leave the restaurant."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Food was decent but a little pricey even if it was very nicely plated and served. Staff were attentive and helpful and overall it was a good experience although there was a little confusion over my OpenTable booking.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"There was a big group of us who hadn't seen each other in a very long time, so we were quite slow with ordering, but the attitude we received from the waitress and other staff was unnecessarily brusque.

We didn't let this marr the evening and when the food came out it was surprisingly good. I hadn't actually looked at any reviews, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was a really nice contrast to the service.

Between all of us, it felt like we ordered the entire menu, and everything we ordered everyone seemed to enjoy.

Just a shame that at every turn, the staff made us feel like we were putting them out."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Had a lovely meal in the restaurant at St Martins Lane. Food was fabulous and there was an interesting menu of cocktails, which we enjoyed with great quality olives.

The staff were friendly and attentive and keen to give good service and a great experience.

Note to management: please give James and Juliana a decent corkscrew! They were fantastic but hampered in their efforts to deliver a fine bottle of St Emillion because a poor quality corkscrew ruined the cork!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Wonderful restaurant. Highly recommended. Great pre theatre menu. Interesting food and excellent food.

I had the carpaccio and it was so delicious I asked the waitress to explain the ingredients. I then had the trout with delicious courgette with honey glazed carrots, which was also Delicious.

The sommelier was also very helpful. The proseco and carafe of pinot grigio went well. And it was kept cold which was very appropriate for a warm summer's eyening.

Well decorated. Nice ambience.

We shall return!

A great restaurant."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Had a nice meal in the outdoor terrace area. Lovely atmosphere and didn‚Äôt feel over crowded. I enjoyed my salad. Lovely presentation! There was a great wide range of fresh ingredients although I personally found the dressing was quite sweet which overpowered in places. The service was above and beyond!

We attended for a pre-theatre dinner.
A wonderful experience with fantastic service. Some interesting/abstract dishes on the menu that were fun to try.
The service was fantastic and the setting was romantic.
The camembert was incredible and the watermelon soup, although an obscure dish, was fantastic!
For mains we had sole & ribeye which were well presented and perfectly cooked.
Would happily recommend this to friends and will certainly be back."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. The location is also very beautiful and our waiter, Aarati was really lovely. Would highly recommend!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Great service from the start, was seated and seen to promptly
ordered a prawn starter which we honestly did not enjoy as much but I believe that was due to our palette and not the dish however the staff still noticed this even though we had not mentioned this to them and comped the dish from our final bill which we found very kind
steak was great and even managed to convert my partner to eating medium rare instead of well done after enough convincing from me
the presentation of all courses was great as well which is always important
as id mentioned it was a birthday occasion on our open table reservation the chef was kind enough to send out beautiful desserts for us making the day more special and after this the staff even invited us to visit ‚ÄúBlind Spot‚Äù for cocktails after our meal, where the atmosphere and drinks were amazing
here i was served a great old fashioned even though i asked for this specially as it was not on the menu, i would also reccomend the sydney and the copenhagen
overall great products with even better service thank you :)"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"I had a wonderful experience at Ellamia Caffe! The cozy ambiance and delicious selection of coffee and cakes made it the perfect spot to relax and unwind. Tetiana, who served me, was absolutely fantastic‚Äîher friendly demeanor and excellent service made my visit even more enjoyable. She went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. If you‚Äôre in the area and looking for a great place to enjoy some quality coffee and treats, I highly recommend Ellamia Caffe!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Excellent restaurant, we really liked it here. My colleagues and I decided to celebrate a special event of our company here, our choice fell on this restaurant. And we were not mistaken! The evening was as perfect as it could possibly be planned!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,I sat in outside terrace and ordered a very tasteless glass of rose which took ten minutes as the unfriendly waitress who proceeded ti bring the 2 tables after Mr there drinks before mine. I also had asked for pink prosecco  the drink was ¬£17.90 not worth a fraction  beautiful hotel but this experience brought it down in my estimation
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Absolutely amazing experience, the staff was very friendly! I can understand it‚Äôs a high end restaurant but ‚Äúlet us breathe‚Äù don‚Äôt come to the table every couple of minutes to check on the food or pour the water which is a very kind gesture but no need at all!
This one staff member was absolutely amazing and super friendly which i loved and wished i got his name!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,We had afternoon tea. We had great service from Kohinoor.  She made the experience one we won‚Äôt forget.  She was attentive to our every need.  üëçüëç
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,Very good service from the whole team especially Adan. They brought a surprise bday cake as it was my friend bday! Very attentive service throughout.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,2.0,"Impossibly slow service. The restaurant was mostly empty, plenty of disorganised waiters, each time a different person coming to our table and forgetting our request.

The food - lamb ribs were very good but served lukewarm, duck rillettes was bad, ratatouille was nice.

Atmosphere- soulless, nothing special, not like the photos at all."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Enjoyed the festive afternoon tea.

Food was great, especially the savoury selection. This is one of my favourite afternoon teas in London.

Staff are fabulous, in particular Monika was friendly and professional. She Made everyone feel very welcome."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The best meal I‚Äôve had in ages! Every dish was incredible, full of flavour and brilliant service. Our server Manuel was very attentive, thank you."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Lovely dining room, and servers were courteous and attentive. There were a couple of breakfast options for those who require gluten-free meals, but not sure if it would be celiac safe. Was a bit disappointed that the acai bowl is actually just yogurt with acai powder, but it was still very tasty. Full English was alright, nothing special. Unfortunately, the cappuccino ordered was only tepid in temperature, but when brought to the server's attention it was quickly remade. Overall, the experience was OK, but there are better options in the area for breakfast."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Restaurant at hotel! Breakfast is good and basic!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Wonderful tea service, including a vegan option.  The art in the room also has great character.  Our server Monika was also great and provided nice explanations of each tea service item.  Definitely a great experience!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Absolutely wonderful meal at this hotel restaurant. Very serious chef. Salade Nicoise and chicken were both terrific. Extremely good value for London. Their Rioja by the glass is also great value. Highly recommended.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"A lovely time with the family for my partner's birthday lunch. Bottomless brunch. Lobster Benedict was amazing.
Our lovely waiter Anastasiia was attentive at every step, Vivien the Manager visited our table to welcome us. Marek, the Bartender made an excellent birthday cocktail for my partner. Tobacco dock was delicious!

Thank you and will visit again."

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We were looking for somewhere to eat before a theatre show and found this. The food was excellent and Monika, our waitress, look after us extremely well. Highly recommended."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We had a lovely dinner before our show. Our waiter, Manuel, made sure that the food came out in time, and helped us celebrate our anniversary."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,4.0,"Manuel was lovely and attentive, the vibe was quiet and pleasant, food presentation and taste were great although the portions were a bit small.

Chicken was sous-vide, so please consider if you don't like your food being cooked in a plastic bag.
Good vegetarian suggestions on the menu and excellent attention to food allergies from the waiter.

Charging 13.5% service charge and then asking the guest to state an additional sum for the tip and to write the new total has put us in an uncomfortable situation but overall a pleasant experience."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,The food was extra fresh and so many offerings at the breakfast buffet! Monika was especially pleasant and helpful!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"recently visited this beautiful place and it was nothing short of a delightful experience. From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome ‚Äì warm smiles, genuine hospitality, and attentiveness that felt personal without being overwhelming.

The food? Simply amazing. Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and clearly crafted with care.

What made the evening even better was the ambiance ‚Äì cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for both intimate dinners and gatherings with friends. Special shoutout to Vanessa, who went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"We turned up as per our booking on Christmas Day and the restaurant informed us they are not doing  a la carte menu but during booking their website allowed us to book for meal without Christmas menu (¬£150 pp)

So misleading and completely ruined our Christmas."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great restaurant! We managed to spend an unforgettable evening here with a boyfriend. It was a wonderful evening and not least thanks to the restaurant!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,I came to the brunch at St martins lane and the food was amazing! Besides the service from Frayer and Jo√£o was brilliant and very warm.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Lovely start to the day here every morning, and the hospitality of all staff, particularly Kohinoor was exceptional. Thank you for taking care of my mates and I! Can‚Äôt wait to return"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"We just had a fabulous afternoon tea with my 10-years old daughter in The Den.  All the food were perfectly presented in a stylish bird-themed china and the cake stand. The best bit was the taste - full of flavours and not-too-sweet.

It was clearly the best afternoon tea we have ever had (we even tried one at The Shard - was too sweet and too crowded ).

Juliana was so friendly and helpful with accommodating our dietary requestüíï

We will surely come back....for more!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,2.0,"We ordered an omelette and acai bowl. The acai bowl was not an acai bowl. It actually contained no acai at all and was just a yogurt base. When we asked our waitress about it she confirmed there was no acai in it at all and that it was just a yogurt bowl with fruit. It would have been nice if she would have flagged that the name was incorrect on the menu as we assumed the acai was mixed with the yogurt based off the name and description. It was good, but very disappointing at the same time as it was not what I ordered. I would have definitely ordered something else if I would have been aware. The omelette was very good with a lot of spinach which was a nice change up from other places that skimp on it."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Food was fantastic and the service was top tier! Juliana, our server, was simply amazing!"
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Great food, surprisingly creative and delicious  ‚ÄúBlack Forest‚Äù dessert , and a wonderful server in Aarati who was delightful."

The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,I dropped in after the theatre for dessert. Manuel assisted in choosing a delicious pan Scott‚Äôs and a cheese plate. Superb service.
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"The afternoon tea at The Den was amazing, the taste and look of everything was amazing. We went with a 8 mo baby and the seating disposition left enough space for him not to be overwhelmed, besides that the staff was super friendly. Kahinoor served us the whole time and made us feel very comfortable and accommodated.
My mum, who is very picky about food, and my husband who is picky about the amount of food üòÇ  both left very happy after it.
The next table had a dog so it seems it is also pet friendly.
Finally, I can't help mentioning the decoration of the room that was funny and interesting, we had a nice moment checking the paintings."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"I‚Äôm staying at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Hotel and had breakfast at the restaurant this morning. The continental buffet was solid‚Äîfresh fruit, yogurt, granola, and a decent pain au chocolat‚Äîbut the Shakshuka was the real standout. Frayer was attentive without being overbearing, making the experience seamless. The seating was surprisingly comfortable, and the atmosphere felt relaxed. I‚Äôm looking forward to breakfast there again."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"This place was really nice! Service was really good, they accomodated us as a walk-in, and we were treated really well. The atmosphere was super chill."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,1.0,"Look, we came here for the great reviews but we noticed a huge lack of execution. The service was fine but our cut of meat was not great and the dessert was off putting, there are better places to eat in the city, I would not recommend."
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,Great food. Great ambiance and top service firm Nuna!
The Restaurant at St Martins Lane London,5.0,"Excellent restaurant, we got there by accident, but were absolutely satisfied with the quality of service and taste!"

Behind Restaurant,,Óóä
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic lunch!
Such a beautiful restaurant!
Intimate, friendly, special.
The chefs produced the most exquisite flavours, which we devoured!
Audrey was very knowledgeable about all the wines and was lovely too.
Highly recommend this restaurant, it‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs delicious and it‚Äôs small and intimate. Everything is done in front of you, absolutely loved it!
Will be back, I wish Andy continued success."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great experience. Fantastic for those who love seafood, as it's the focus of their menu. They're not necessarily pushing boundaries with their cooking, but their quality and skill is undoubted. Very well deserved of their michelin star, probably one of our favorite 1-star restaurants in London now."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind is an absolute gem, easily the best meal I‚Äôve had this year. From the moment you step inside, the atmosphere feels warm, refined, and welcoming. The open kitchen concept makes dining here an incredible experience ‚Äì you get to watch a passionate, highly skilled team at work, and the precision and artistry behind every plate is mesmerising.

The food is exceptional. Every course is beautifully thought out, with bold flavours balanced perfectly and ingredients allowed to truly shine. You can tell there is genuine care and creativity behind every dish, and the pacing of the tasting menu is spot on. The wine pairings were equally impressive, elevating the whole evening.

Service was faultless ‚Äì attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and genuinely enthusiastic. It‚Äôs rare to find a place where every detail, from presentation to hospitality, feels so considered.

Well done Andy and team üëèüèº"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent in all ways. Incredible flavours with a wide range, from fresh asian to rich french styles. Brilliant, especially for pescatarians"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"It was a fantastic experience, showing just how unique flavours can come from simple ingredients. Perfect for seafood lovers, though they‚Äôre more than happy to accommodate non-meat eaters as well. While we expected mostly seafood, the chef surprised us with refreshing herb sorbets and fruity shots between courses, which was a delightful touch. The atmosphere is definitely more relaxed than most fine dining spots, with soft lighting and mellow music adding to the charm. The chefs were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making it feel almost like dining at home with friends. And don‚Äôt miss out on checking the unique restrooms while you‚Äôre there."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing. Incredible. Phenomenal. What a bloody treat! Went there last night and from start to finish it was incredible. The ten courses each had their own spectacular taste and we decided to go with the wine pairing - the wine glasses were extremely generous. The restaurant was very accommodating to my allergies - they even remembered them and the dish i had as a replacement was potentially my favourite (i did mention for it to be put back on the menu!). Really thank you for such an incredible night, we really won‚Äôt forget it. Special mention to Connor, Audrey, Olivier, Giorgio and Andy (sorry if I missed anyone). Will be telling everyone about this night for many years to come."
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"Good food and creative dishes at Behind.

Had the tasting menu on the 7th of February.

Highlights is the broth dish and the ice cream in the end! The apple skin and carrot juice is also amazing and very refreshing!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"What a place! The food was fantastic. This is probably my favourite spot I‚Äôve been to in London. Interesting seafood focused food with some twists. They use the sauce and natural ingredients for the flavour no unnecessary added salt or sugar here - really packs a punch. The head chef is a lovely chap as well and so are his staff - the front of house staff member and the other chefs / servers were also great. Lean and effective team. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. They could also accommodate me being a pescatarian as well very easily and didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it (just let
them know in advance). To top it all off my girlfriend and I had a lovely bottle of rose. They‚Äôve nailed the design inside and the vibe is cool but not over the top. Nothing too fancy. Spot on."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,A super friendly and down to earth team serving exquisite food from multiple influences. Such a great experience!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Incredible experience here at Behind. From the moment we stepped in we felt special and truly part of an experience. Starting off with incredible drinks from the sommelier who really knew what she was doing to being served our courses by the chefs themselves. Each course was special within its own right but led beautifully to the next. If you want to truly taste something amazing in London then you must book the tasting menu here!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Here‚Äôs a great example of a Michelin-experience made right.

Setting is a very design-friendly chefs table with the perfect ambience and acoustics. Service is right on point with great hosting, relaxed conversations and highly knowledgeable about their food and preparation.

The food follows the key. Perfectly, and thoughtfully, balanced and prepared to give you something from the whole taste palate.

Went for the lunch set-menu, which was very good value-for-monetary ¬£64pp. Highly recommend other to do the same, or entrust them for a dinner. I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

- Value for money? Yes
- Worth a detour? Yes
- Best for (occasion)? Foodie experience
- Would I go back? Absolutely"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Seafood, made magic. The mixture of textures alone on each dish will surprise you in the best possible way. A delight."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"From the moment we walked in, the service at this restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. The waitstaff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely warm, striking the perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness.

As for the food and drinks‚Äîdivine is the only word that fits. Every dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, clearly crafted with care and fresh ingredients. The cocktails were equally impressive, with a creative flair and perfect balance.

This place delivers an experience that delights all the senses. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Had the most unforgettable dining experience at Behind.

The intimate setting, paired with a warm and passionate team, set the stage for a stunning 10-course seafood tasting menu that was nothing short of artful. Each dish was incredible, but the standouts for me were the scallop with kipper sauce and the Sicilian red prawn. I‚Äôm still dreaming about them."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Every dish was superb these chefs know what they‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶created an amazing space to enjoy amazing seafood fine dining. One of my favourite restaurants in London.

All dishes are served by the chefs themselves no waiters no menus everything is a surprise and explained by the chefs. Definitely a food experience. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"I heard so many good things about this place before I decided to make a reservation. To be honest, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of seafood but I was convinced to give this place a shot and safe to say I was not disappointed at all.

8-course tasting menu ¬£118 pp (when i went) and one-seating per night. Unlike some fine dining restaurants, Behind was bang for buck. Each dish was well crafted with a lot of thought put into it.

I would say that I felt like the food had a lot of elements of Japanese-like flavours which was very much to my palette!"
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at this chef's table, known for its surprise seafood-focused menu. Here's my take on t to he experience.

The service was a bit of a mixed bag. It wasn't unfriendly, but it didn't quite exude the warmth you'd hope for in a dining establishment. It seemed as though the staff were efficient but not overly engaging.

Now, onto the food. The meal started on a high note with the first few dishes, which were truly enjoyable.

However, it was disappointing that the latter dishes were marred by excessive saltiness, which left a less than pleasant aftertaste. It was a sharp contrast to the promising start.

Overall, dining here is indeed an experience, but it may not be one that compels me to return. While the surprise menu and the initial courses were memorable, the inconsistency in service and food quality left a lot to be desired. If you're an adventurous diner looking for something different, it might be worth a try, but be prepared for a mixed experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Exceptional, if you haven‚Äôt been there you need to go. A unique experience and more than worthy of its Michelin star"
Behind Restaurant,1.0,"It‚Äôs the worst Michelin restaurant experiences I‚Äôve ever had, especially the service part. Chef Andy Beynon is very rude. There are way better Michelin (and non Michelin) restaurants elsewhere.

I arrived on time while my friend was late.
There was miscommunication about the serving with the manager at the beginning as I asked if they can save for my friend what she might miss and serve her when she arrives. She says they will try accommodate. In that case, when the chef Andy later came and ask me if I want to start or wait for my friend, I said I‚Äôll wait. What he didn‚Äôt mention at all is that if I don‚Äôt start without my friend I won‚Äôt be served some of the first courses. Neither on the booking email or on their website says ‚ÄòFood is STRICTLY served all together with all guests and you as a guest paying us money for an experience won‚Äôt be served the food even if we agreed to accommodate a situation.‚Äô He says it‚Äôs ‚Äôobvious‚Äô when he asked me if I want to start. When I asked about it later after realising I was not served the first few courses he said ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt get it because your friend was late. Nothing I can do and I have no solution.‚Äô No smile, cold face, great customer service."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Sitting at the chef's table was an amazing experience. Alongside only 8 other guests, we watched the chefs prepare and serve our meals while taking the time to explain them to us. The place felt cozy and stylish and talking to the chefs made it very special. Just for this, they deserve top marks.

As for the food, it was mostly fish dishes. The meal started with mackerel and trout, both with surprising flavors that balanced well. Everything was nicely done. The prawn broth and pumpkin crab ravioli were my favorites. The cod cheek looked great but tasted too salty and needed something more, maybe a bit of sourness. But that didn‚Äôt impact our 5 star experience."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A true masterpiece of fine dining, this world-class restaurant delivers an unforgettable experience. The service is flawless, the ambiance is refined, and every dish is a work of art‚Äîboth visually and in flavor. Highlights include expertly prepared courses, thoughtful wine pairings, and a kitchen that blends precision with creativity. From start to finish, it‚Äôs a seamless journey through culinary excellence."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"This was my birthday treat and absolutely one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  The room is amazing, the cooking is exceptional and the staff wonderful.

Impossible to pick a standout course as every dish was fabulous, having everything brought by the chefs was lovely and Andy is an incredibly talented man and a genuinely lovely person."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great overall experience and delicious food. The tasting menu was well crafted and creative, focused mainly on fresh seafood. The layout of the restaurant and the atmosphere was excellent as all the guests sits facing the open kitchen and see the food being prepared. Service was also brilliant as the staff will give you a brief intro of each dish. Highly recommended."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Our six-course chef's tasting lunch menu at Behind was a special treat. Five chefs and no wait staff. The chefs served and explained the dishes one by one. The visual feast, the intense flavours, the anticipation as we watched them working in the kitchen and plating to perfection ‚Äì it all added up to a supremely special experience. I do wish they'd given us a menu because there was an incredible amount of detail in every dish and I can't remember it all.

The photos show all five chefs at work. The first course was the only one that had more than one component ‚Äì four in all. The silky striped sauce was added at the table to great effect. Two or three trout eggs are nestled amongst the edible flowers. The tasty crispy cracker was so thin it melted in your mouth. The next course was half a quail egg filled with teensy little shrimp with tiny black eyes surrounded by delicate ramen and ""sea ramen."" All eaten with a utensil that looked like a small pair of tongs, much easier to wield than chopsticks. On finishing, we were advised to pick up the bowl and slurp down the divine broth. The dessert was some of the best chocolate I've ever had with another cracker, sweet this time, and a perfect quenelle of ice cream in between. (My daughter told me that's what it's called - she's passionate about food and researches where to eat whenever I visit her in London from Canada.)

We also really enjoyed the five chefs and their multiple nationalities and accents. A marvellous experience overall."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Wonderful dining experience. All the dishes tasted amazing. Love the relaxing atmosphere. They have a small team of chefs and staffs, yet they are all very friendly. Great value for money. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Going to Behind is an experience.
We went to a lot of great restaurants already, but this one is special. The chefs are doing The cooking which you can see from your seats and at the same time they are also serving it. The chef Andy Beynon is super friendly and talks with the guests and explains if necessary. It is a super great, casual atmosphere and a different approach to a Michelin Star restaurant.
The menu is super nice and it becomes better and better from course to course. The chocolate dessert is the best I ever had! I really cannot understand how you can still be hungry afterwards. It was really a special night."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent menu, great atmosphere. All cooking is done in front of you so it makes it a little interactive as well. Servings are well spaced out and not too slow as other reviews mention. Plenty of food overall, with some great flavours and textures. The brioche croissant is unbelievable. Would come again."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Today's food experience was lunch at @behindrestaurant in London Fields, London. The surprise seafood-focused menu was sensational. From the minute I arrived, there was chatty conversation from the chefs who then cooked and served each of the courses. Such a fun afternoon with a front row seat to some really fabulous food."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A must go if you‚Äôre a foodie in London restaurant scene. Chefs table style design. Amazing fish menu where you find out whilst you eat and they surprise you with each and one of the dishes. Service is phenomenal, shout out to Nathan and Jonny who made our stay one to remember."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing food and service. Very unique and intimate experience, with only 12 other diners. Open kitchen concept allows you to admire the craft and art that goes into the food. Glad I got to try this place out and would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"The food and service were absolutely sublime. The savoury dishes were all perfection, my personal favourite being the chicken and Sea Bream. Magical, only downside is the shared bathroom with the hotel."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Behind offers an exceptional dining experience with its unique open-kitchen concept, allowing diners to witness the artistry behind each dish. The tasting menu is a delightful journey of flavors, showcasing seasonal ingredients and creative combinations. Each course is beautifully presented and thoughtfully prepared. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive, enhancing the overall experience. A must-visit for those who appreciate fine dining with a personal touch"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing Dinner, outstanding service, My out of town guest was very impressed. Every dish on the menu was carefully designed to match the highest standard and exceeded our taste buds expectations."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Can‚Äôt fault it! Amazing seafood-based tasting menu with combination of great flavours. Modern open plan set-up but feel very cosy. Chefs introduced each dish to us when serving and it was a very enjoyable and personal dining experience.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Great laidback atmosphere with fantastic food. Very good prize-value proposition for a tasting menu of such quality in London.

Definitely recommend, specially for someone who wants to try their first one-star Michelin Restaurant. Or whoever wants to have good produce with inventive combinations of flavours without paying a fortune.

Would advise them to have a landline in case customers need to reach them (which was my case)."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"A remarkable, intimate and truly delicious lunch. I highly recommend it for lunch or dinner. The room is so beautiful and the service was impeccable. Chefs will serve and then discuss the dishes. Don‚Äôt miss Behind üôåüèª"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Went here for my birthday and really enjoyed my time there! A seafood inspired restaurant in Hackneyü§© would love to revisit but sadly they don‚Äôt give birthday surprises..
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"6 stars all round. Inconspicuous setting for such an elaborate and lavish occasion. Sumptuous interior design elements underpinning the attention to detail for the whole operation - from greeting to goodbye.

And the food reflects all of the above and so much more. Confident, almost effortless flavour combinations."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Andy Beynon's restaurant is a wonderful space that reflects his passion and drive. There is an 18-cover copper horseshoe counter encircling the kitchen with a couple of rectangular tables almost in the kitchen space itself, all with fantastic views of the meal as it is being prepared. The ceiling is warehouse bare and the music reflects Beynon's personal tastes and is balanced to the course being offered. Beynon is an accomplished chef and a charming host. The chef and his brigade are part of the service at Behind, talking to diners about each dish as it is presented to them.

I have sampled some of Beynon's creations at City and Pollen Street Socials, when he was Jason Atherton's development chef, as well as at Hibiscus where he supported Claude Bosi. He has imagination and flair and it is little surprise that he landed a Michelin star within 21 days of opening his own place.

We enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu as a surprise (i.e. we did not want to know in advance what we would be eating). The whole room gets the same meal, with slight adaptions for dietary requirements. We also asked for the wine pairing. It is clear from the wine list that Beynon values artisan producers and is ethically inclined - there are many organic options from small vineyards across the globe.

The main focus is on seafood, sustainable, best-on-the-day produce that is served with care and a keen attention to detail. The brigade are not trapped at a particular station but move according to their role, as well as coming out of the kitchen to present their creations. On our visit we enjoyed fresh peas, smoked trout and pike garnished with trout roe, served in a paper thin fine pastry shell with pea shoots - a wonderful, textured mouthful; native oyster taco and oyster with cucumber, buttermilk, horseradish and oyster foam; crab pannacotta with white meat and sliced sharp gooseberries from Beynon's mother's allotment - a successful combination that has made more people than just his mother smile; another crab dish with ajo blanco and melon and cucumber balls with a warm crab broth and fine sardine toast; scallops with pickled fennel; wonderous hake, roasted, in a sherry sauce, served with fish croquettes coated in crisp scales and a silky, smoky mash scattered with seeds (the wine pairing to this was sublime - a glorious Spanish Red tasting of smoked Ribena); tender 7 day-hung guinea fowl accompanied by a superb South African granache from Wellington; a potion of rhubarb served in a tall glass with a foam to cleanse the palate; a subtle herb sorbet (basil, tarragon and verbena) served with lemon curd custard - quite sublime with a sharp raspberry and calamari sorbet with white strawberries as a refreshing finisher; a white chocolate and cardamom bomb; and a going home gift of freshly baked brioche pastry to go with coffee next day - a delicious reminder of the night before.

Beynon is a cool Hackney resident running a very cool Hackney venue. That he finds time to be a loving father and husband on top of steering his culinary dream is amazing. He recruited one of his brigade when the pair of them were taking their kids out for a stroll and recognised each other and got talking. Great to live and work locally at such a fantastic restaurant. Thank you for wonderful evening."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"This is the ultimate restaurant for all seafood lovers who want to experience a unique tasting menu using only the best products the UK waters have to offer.
My partner and I had a delicious anniversary celebration and we enjoyed every single bite of their seafood tasting menu - thank you team!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Sublime. We had a great time, food was amazing and so were the staff. Weve been to Michelin Star places and often leave wallet lighter & thinking nothing more than 'it was ok'. Not here, here I felt like I had my first Michelin star experience. The food is art on a plate and each plate an explosion of flavour. Their wine paring is by far the most generous Ive ever had, we both left a little bit wobbly on our feet.

If you love seafood you will love this place."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"We had dinner in this restaurant a few days ago- highly recommended place! Very affordable prices, nice and friendly waitresses. Definitely one of our favorite restaurant now! 10/10"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Very nice experience at Behind Restaurant.  From start to finish each dish is a new experience of tastes and flavors.
Each cooking is measured to perfection.
The dishes are balanced and respect each product.
Having less even worked at ""La Tante Claire"" with Pierre Kaufmann, at ""The Terrasse restaurant"" at the Dorchester, ""the Waterside Inn"", with Michel Roux and also at the ""Gravetye Manor"".
I can only congratulate chef Andy Beynon and  his entire team for the work accomplished.
Continue to work and respect the fresh products you serve us.
Once again congratulations for this wonderful moment."
Behind Restaurant,4.0,"1 Michelin star spot with a great sweeping wooden table top counter dining that seated 14 around it. Very close to brat at climpsons arch in London fields. Firstly the staff were all fantastic - the chefs served all the dishes and were really approachable and great to chat about the food and menu with. The sommelier was also particularly friendly and knowledgeable and just a lovely person. Really nice to see Andy Beynon himself taking time to chat with all the diners in the restaurant and clearly took pride in his food and the restaurant.

In terms of the food itself, it‚Äôs a surprise seafood focussed tasting menu (you get the menu at the end as a takeaway), with c.14 courses which means each is relatively small and ultimately very ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù if you know what I mean, but not necessarily in a good way. Whilst everything was cooked well with ok flavours, it‚Äôs hard to classify many of the dishes as truly standout that you are going to be yearning for over the next few days/weeks/months or raving about to friends and family. It was all technically proficient cooking for sure but would love to see some more innovative ideas on the plate and more knockout flavours. Crab, hake, and guinea fowl dishes were the highlights for us. Total bill c.¬£208 for two with a couple of drinks each. Overall 13/20"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Absolutely loved this place. Every course was amazing which is rare to hit it all and also very reasonably priced. Very seafood heavy but I love seafood and the mash was just ridiculous! Thank you for the best evening!

Behind Restaurant,5.0,Loved our meal here - each dish was delicious and the whole open plan vibe of the restaurant made it feel really intimate. Not the sort of place I would visit frequently but an ideal place for a treat!
Behind Restaurant,5.0,"Food was absolutely incredible and overall a wonderful experience from Andy and his team. Personal and Intimate setting. A hidden gem in East London, everyone must go. A well deserved Michelin star!"
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Came here for friend‚Äôs birthday. Had very high expectations and it was decent. We were still hungry after the tasting lunch menu though üòÇ
Behind Restaurant,2.0,"Big disappointment

Portions are tasty but very small and I was still hungry after the 8 courses tasting menu. The chef proposed an extra dessert for customers who were still hungry like me. I thought it was going to be free but was charged extra.
The service is good but it was the first time I left a Michelin star restaurant hungry and wanting for more, even after spending 300 pounds for 2 people."
Behind Restaurant,5.0,10 courses served over 3 hours. Brilliant food and wine pairing as well as amazing service.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Lovely space and atmosphere. Enjoyed the seating arrangement where you can watch the chat with the chefs. Enjoyed the fish based concept and the wine pairing was amazing.

Behind Restaurant,5.0,Superb. beyond/behind superb meal. Wonderful to watch the chefs prepare the food and serve it so deftly and in a chilled way. Fish and seafood for 2021. Book early and enjoy. Fully worth the price (and get the wine pairing).
Behind Restaurant,5.0,Food is exceptional. This restaurant has some of the freshest food I have ever tasted. The meat is top quality. I highly highly recommend this restaurant.
Behind Restaurant,5.0,One of the best fine dining/tasting menu I have ever had in London. The food was very tasty and creative. They served all types of seafood that I love.

The Wolseley,5.0,"Great place to visit! We went for afternoon tea and it was absolutely wonderful. Superb service, very attentive and friendly. The tea was delicious as were the different variations of sandwiches, salmon, chicken, cheddar. The scones were amazing as was the cheesecake. All in all definitely worth a visit, classy!"
The Wolseley,1.0,"Great decor.
Moderate food. Great tea.
Non existent service.

I felt that if you don't look or dress a certain way, you get treated differently.

Toilets don't flush properly.

They have a service charge which is discretionary but when we asked for it, the manager looked as if we wouldn't know what it meant. Keep an eye out.

And no, I would not go back there even if you paid me."
The Wolseley,5.0,Best to reserve a spot online so don't have to wait at all. The service was great and I really love the food. Will come back next for their afternoon tea.
The Wolseley,5.0,"Amazing spot for afternoon tea. Excellent scones, sandwiches and cakes - especially the chicken curry sandwich and the cheesecakes. Also highly recommend thier gin martinis."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Our visit to The Wolseley was absolutely wonderful. From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere felt elegant yet welcoming. We enjoyed a lovely brunch, followed later by afternoon tea, and everything exceeded our expectations. The coffee was rich and expertly prepared, and the afternoon tea was beautifully presented, with a perfect selection of sandwiches, scones, and pastries. What made the experience truly special was the impeccable service ‚Äî attentive, warm, and thoughtful without ever feeling intrusive. Every detail was handled with care, making our visit truly memorable. We can‚Äôt wait to return."
The Wolseley,2.0,"A long-anticipated visit that turned out to be thoroughly (VERY)disappointing.

This was a place I had always intended to visit at least once in my life, but never quite made it‚Äîuntil now. Naturally, I arrived with great anticipation, only to be met with profound disappointment.

Let me begin with this: at a fine restaurant, one may forgive many things if the food is exceptional. However, when a place commands high prices, one expects not just culinary merit but also a certain standard of ambiance, service, and refinement. Sadly, this establishment failed to deliver on nearly every front.

First: üëâ ‚ÄúDo note that a separate cover charge is applied per person.‚Äù WHY???????

Reservation required a credit card to guard against no-shows. Fair enough; that‚Äôs become the norm.

Second:
Upon arrival, we were left standing awkwardly at the entrance, ignored by the staff who were too busy chattering among themselves. When they did acknowledge us, it was with the tone and volume one might expect in a marketplace, not a dining room. Despite several empty tables and our having a reservation, we were inexplicably left waiting.

Third:
While not directly the restaurant‚Äôs fault, the sheer volume of noise from other diners made it almost impossible to hear the serving staff. The acoustics were poor and the overall atmosphere chaotic.

Fourth:
Feeling rather unwelcome, we limited our order to just the main courses. I must say, I have never encountered lamb that tough in my life. However, I will give credit where due‚Äîthe sauces accompanying both the lamb and the chicken were quite delicious.

Fifth:
When I politely enquired about the location of the lavatory, the response I received‚Äî‚Äúunder the clock‚Äù‚Äîwas delivered with an unmistakably unpleasant expression. I had asked using the proper British phrasing, and given the exterior suggested a formal establishment, I had not expected to be met with such brusqueness. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if this was a matter of inadequate training or simply poor manners.

Sixth:
While the venue might appear elegant at a glance, there was no apparent dress code. Some diners looked as though they had just come from a jog or stepped in off the street in slippers. Whatever impression of sophistication this place hopes to project, it is swiftly undone by the casual presentation of its clientele.

Seventh:
As we were leaving, not a single member of staff asked how our meal had been, whether we needed anything further, or even offered a farewell. We might as well have been walking out of a supermarket rather than a supposedly refined restaurant. It left a distinctly sour taste.

‚∏ª

In summary:
This establishment is sorely lacking in training, decorum, and genuine hospitality. A serious re-evaluation by management is urgently needed."
The Wolseley,5.0,"This is just a wonderful restaurant. Amazing interior, it‚Äôs honestly worth going for that alone, great service and excellent food. I went for breakfast and it was very good. Had the haggis and eggs on toast to start, then pastries and a hot chocolate gourmand. All really good."
The Wolseley,4.0,"Breakfast at The Wolseley was a wonderful experience! The Pancakes with Berries were fluffy and full of flavor, and the Egg Royal was perfectly poached with rich hollandaise. The elegant ambiance and attentive service made it even better. A lovely spot for a refined breakfast!"
The Wolseley,3.0,"I had high hopes for the food and thought it would be really good but it was just ""ok"" l had a the set menu but regardless of this the food could have been better. The goulash lacked flavour and the cauliflower soup was just like eatting a bowl of fatty cream. The waitress also kept coming over to try and take our bowls when we had not finished to the point that l had to say... ""are we slow eaters?"" the decor is beautiful but the price of the food isn't justified. My desert was ¬£13 and l would have got better from Mark's and Spencers."
The Wolseley,5.0,"My first time at The Wolseley in Piccadilly. I took a friend to lunch there, as a birthday treat. It‚Äôs a lovely restaurant, with a Viennese feel to the food and d√©cor. We were sat at a window seat, and the whole experience was high quality. The food was wonderful, the staff were friendly and attentive, and the restaurant had a very nice atmosphere. I especially enjoyed the kedgeree. We will definitely return in the near future."
The Wolseley,2.0,"The food was decent, but the service was very slow. It was a busy Sunday night, and the server seemed to be covering too many tables. He was friendly and clearly trying his best, but it felt like there just wasn‚Äôt enough staff to provide proper service. Btw, service charge is 15%."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Had breakfast here very recently. My second visit but the first for my friends who loved the decor and atmosphere.
My only slight issue was that the waitress, spoke very quietly, didnt explain well and misunderstood one of our orders.
Although a minor issue we would definitely return, a real gem.
You must book ahead to get youf preferred timings."
The Wolseley,5.0,"4.5/5 - this is my dream atmosphere, hands down. My husband gave his food a 3.5 but I gave mine a 4.5 so we settled on 4.

Lovely teas, coffee, and it's a great spot to have breakfast. Their prices are changed from when I took the menu picture but that's the gist of their options!"
The Wolseley,5.0,Exceptional service and truly delicious food. The oatmeal with jam and the salmon eggs Benedict were out of this world! The interior is absolutely stunning ‚Äî a beautiful place to enjoy a perfect breakfast.
The Wolseley,4.0,"This central London institution has long been a favourite of the city‚Äôs power players‚Äîit was once said that more deals were done over breakfast here than in the boardroom.

The atmosphere is pure old-school London glamour, with dark wood, crisp white tablecloths, gleaming silverware, and a quiet confidence throughout.

It draws a mix of upscale tourists and suited regulars, all soaking up the timeless charm. Breakfast is particularly excellent, with flawless service and perfectly executed classics. Yes, it‚Äôs expensive‚Äîbut it earns it. For a refined start to the day or a special morning meeting, it doesn‚Äôt get much better."
The Wolseley,4.0,"The Wolseley has a long history of serving English cuisine, spanning over a century. Patrons from around the world enjoy its excellent breakfast, lunch, and private dining options."
The Wolseley,5.0,"My first time at the Wolsey, I‚Äôve wanted to go for a while and it lived up to my expectations. No booking restaurant very busy, I said could you squeeze me in for lunch only me so happy to sit anywhere, no problem sat down in 30 seconds with a bottle of water and a menu, lovely tradition surroundings, waiting staff immaculate dressed with waistcoats and aprons. I went for the Smoked Haddock Kedgeree, stunning dish slightly curried with a freshly poached egg on top nice portion and just the right amount of smoked haddock mixed in with the rice, ¬£24:95 had a mint tea to follow served in a glass t pot and a nice glass cup ¬£5:95, ¬£5:95 for a large water came to just under ¬£50 with a 15% Tip not cheap but so nice to be served so well in a very busy restaurant by nice people. Will definitely take the gang back next time. Another good point as I was alone I had a few work emails to do on my phone so I was there for almost 21/2 hours no problem at all, no rush and felt very comfortable. Great place"
The Wolseley,5.0,"A beauty in a caf√©/restaurant like I‚Äôve rarely seen! Not only was the food and tea absolutely delicious, but I was also welcomed with great hospitality and attentive service. A place I can highly recommend!"
The Wolseley,4.0,"The Wolseley offers a charming atmosphere with elegant d√©cor and a classic menu. The service was attentive and professional, and the food was well-prepared, especially the breakfast options. While it‚Äôs slightly on the pricey side, the overall experience feels special and worth it for a treat. Would definitely return."
The Wolseley,4.0,"The Wolseley sits in my list ever since I saw it from others‚Äô posts. The food was delicious and the decor was stunning. However, staff were always busy, we waited a bit to get our bill. Overall, it worths a visit!"
The Wolseley,5.0,"We went here for afternoon tea and WOW! Although there are a lot of trendy other spots in London, the pricing is a bit absurd and didn't feel suited for us because we didn't want to eat a ton of pastries. This was the perfect stop for that reason. The price was beyond reasonable and the atmosphere was just as nice. We enjoyed tea with scones. I highly recommend stopping by if you're interested in trying tea without wasting hours and breaking the bank."
The Wolseley,5.0,"A beautiful place! Stunning interiors and lovely staff. Food was great, and served in good time. Will be back!"
The Wolseley,4.0,"We had their afternoon tea set with reservation, scones are great, clotted cream is very delicious! Others like sandwiches and desserts taste traditional."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Warning: California/Oregon Native here so this review will have a west coast American bias.
We went to The Wolseley for afternoon tea on our first day in London. My wife had been there several years ago and wanted me to experience it.

We both did the CLASSIC AFTERNOON TEA. I selected the English Breakfast Tea and my wife went with Earl Grey. Both were brewed perfectly and served in the cutest kettles. Almost all the Kettles we saw around us were unique/different which I thought was a lot of fun.

If you have never done afternoon tea it's definitely something you should experience. The clotted cream with scones was just amazing and paired perfectly with tea. The small sandwiches were mostly good. I wasn't a fan of the onion one, but the cucumber, salmon, and egg were all excellent. Our least favorite bits were the desserts, but they were okay. Just not something I would specifically go back for. I'd take more scones and clotted cream to be honest.

If you're going to go for Afternoon Tea in London, 10/10 would recommend going here. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
The Wolseley,5.0,"My partner and I were tourists in London. After a lot of research, we decided to go with the Wolseley for our special Afternoon Tea reservation. I‚Äôm so glad we did because I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. From the moment we walked through the door we had beautiful service. The space is beautifully decorated with high ceilings and floor to ceiling windows, making it light and bright. It‚Äôs certainly not a sleepy atmosphere - on the contrary it was quite bustling which gave a feel for the ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù cityscape experience. Even so we never felt rushed and really appreciated the second plate of savories they brought out to us.

I also have to mention THE SCONES. It has been 7 months since our visit and I still dream about them, along with the clotted cream and jam. They are literally the best scones I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I can‚Äôt wait to return!"
The Wolseley,2.0,"Staff should note: Never give the bill while customer is eating.

The service was indifferent - the waitress didn't ask and pour the glass and took away the bottle. No manners.

Booked the afternoon tea and canceled because of the service mainly."
The Wolseley,5.0,"I‚Äôve been to The Wolseley a couple of times now ‚Äî once for breakfast and more recently for dinner ‚Äî and both visits left a great impression. Breakfast there was a standout. The vibe in the morning is calm but buzzing, and the menu has that perfect mix of classics done really well. The space is stunning‚Äîclassic, elegant, and full of that old-school charm that makes you feel like you're somewhere special.

Dinner had that same timeless atmosphere. I tried the caviar, which was good, though honestly not the best I‚Äôve had. Still enjoyable, just not a standout. The rest of the meal was solid, and the service was exactly what you‚Äôd hope for; warm and professional.

Overall, it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in London and looking for a beautiful setting and a refined dining experience. I‚Äôd go back, maybe skip the caviar next time and try something else from the menu."
The Wolseley,5.0,One of the best spots in the city to start the day! The Wolseley has a large menu for both sweet and savory lovers. I enjoyed the eggs and french toast.
The Wolseley,4.0,"Beautiful location. Small portions for afternoon tea. No options for choices of food, just tea. Only ate 2 of the 4 sandwiches due to not liking the other 2. I think this is about the experience and company during your tea."
The Wolseley,5.0,"The Wolseley was an absolute pleasure to dine at. The cauliflower soup was one of the best i‚Äôve had, and the sea bream was light and crisp. The benedict is a bit expensive for what you actually get which was a bit disappointing but overall, food and service were great and it was a pleasant experience."
The Wolseley,2.0,"Really disappointed about the food. The atmosphere is good en de service is friendly. It starts going wrong with the menu. It is all over the place. They have wienser schnitzels, lobsters, kaviaar and cheeseburgers combined with wine bottles up to 700 pound.
The food itself is very boring and consequently very expensive for what you get. Would not recommend this place to anyone."
The Wolseley,3.0,"The high tea wasn't that good as sandwiches were dry and tasted stale. The scones, too, were not nice. Cakes were ok but not amazing. I would have rather gone to the Ritz. The waiters just came once to take our order but didn't come again until I asked for more hot water and the bill. Tea pot was rusted and dark brown inside with tea stains."
The Wolseley,5.0,"I am so glad we visited The Wolseley during our first trip to the UK. The restaurant interior is very classic and beautiful. The service was great, we didn‚Äôt wait long for our food even though restaurant was very busy. Food was amazing! Cant wait to come back!"
The Wolseley,2.0,"I had high hopes for The Wolseley, but this visit fell well short. The food was expensive for what it was, particularly the schnitzel, which was eye-wateringly overpriced for the quality, and my partner‚Äôs fishcakes were overwhelmingly salty. Service was actively poor throughout: wine was poured into a water glass, we had to ask a multiple times to have enough spoons for our table when all of us ordered soup, and the maitre d‚Äô randomly took a single glass while ignoring the rest of our table. Worse still, the wine we ordered was inexplicably handed off to another table. This was replaced, but only after calling attention to the fact that we should have more than one glass left.

A cold draught ran through the dining room, which didn‚Äôt help the atmosphere. For a restaurant that trades so heavily on its reputation, this was a letdown. Two stars only because the setting still has charm, just a shame the experience didn‚Äôt match it. It was supposed to be a special occasion, but I left feeling really disappointed."
The Wolseley,5.0,"It was the best cafe I've been to in London. I liked it so much that I went there twice while traveling in London. The eggs benedict was really delicious, and I was especially impressed by the French toast. It was the best French toast I've ever had. In addition, it was a really classy and luxurious atmosphere, and the gentle staff made it a memorable and happy time. I will definitely go there again when I come to London."
The Wolseley,5.0,"The atmosphere of the place is more than wonderful,  service is excellent, food is delicious, and the staff is smiling and cheerful."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Americans listen up. So this was the first restaurant that this american went to while first visiting london. It was very much worth the trip. It was so authentic and the table set, as you could see in the photo is just so nice. They asked me if I wanted a newspaper to read and I almost did, but I stuck to my phone lol. If you are wanting a good shop to have your tea with lunch or breakfast go here I know I'd bring any friend here with me if I went again. Also their hot chocolate was very decadent as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Wolseley,4.0,"The food was all good quality. I ordered the 3 course set meal and was happy with my French onion soup, souffl√© suisse, and salted caramel eclair, the latter of which I found I liked much better than I expected. My mom also enjoyed her eggs benedict and cr√®me br√ªl√©e, and my dad his sea bream. We were seated in the bar room, so it was rather loud and crowded as it half-served as a waiting room. We spent about $100 for 3 people. It was a good experience, but I didn‚Äôt think it was a must-visit and it didn‚Äôt blow me out of the water. The bathrooms were also only so-so."
The Wolseley,3.0,"Had afternoon tea here. Decor is very nice and atmosphere is great. Food itself was mediocre. There‚Äôs nothing particularly stand out on the afternoon tea. They do handle allergy very well so really appreciate that. Service wasn‚Äôt great as there was mix up on our orders. Personally prefer people to write down the orders instead of going off of memory and get it wrong. Pricing for the afternoon tea is alright. Only downside is that they don‚Äôt have kids pricing. Overall, would not come back for the afternoon tea again."
The Wolseley,4.0,"Came here for afternoon tea. It was fairly decent. The sandwiches were nice, scones were really fresh and tasty and the desserts were ok. I didn‚Äôt think it was particularly outstanding but it was tasty. Some of the desserts were a little too sweet. I enjoyed the hot chocolate. Service was great, our waitress was lovely and gave us gold recommendations for tea. She kindly let us takeaway our leftovers too and wrapped up an extra person for our friend who couldn‚Äôt make it."
The Wolseley,5.0,"The Wolseley, an elegant caf√©-restaurant in London's Piccadilly, offers a quintessentially British dining experience that pays homage to its history as a former motor garage. The interior exudes a grand atmosphere, reminiscent of classic European brasseries, making it a popular spot for both locals and tourists.

Their Traditional English Breakfast is a highlight, featuring perfectly cooked eggs, crispy bacon, premium sausages, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, and toast, all served with a side of black pudding. The portion is generous, embodying the essence of this beloved morning fare.

Equally noteworthy is the Bubble and Squeak, a comforting dish made from leftover vegetables, particularly potatoes and cabbage, which is pan-fried to create a crispy exterior while retaining a soft, flavorful inside. The Wolseley elevates this classic dish, adding a touch of refinement.

Overall, The Wolseley combines historical charm with exceptional British cuisine, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking a taste of traditional fare in an iconic setting."

The high ceilings, stunning chandeliers, and classic art deco design create a luxurious atmosphere that makes the visit feel special even before the first bite.

The menu showcases the best of traditional English cuisine, and every dish we tried was prepared to perfection. From hearty classics to refined options, the flavors were rich, and the ingredients tasted fresh. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of thought and care goes into the preparation of the food.

The service was another highlight. The staff were attentive, friendly, and professional without being overbearing. They were quick to accommodate requests and made us feel welcome throughout the meal.

The Wolseley Caf√© is more than just a restaurant; it‚Äôs an experience. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion or simply indulge in excellent English food in a luxurious setting, it‚Äôs the perfect choice. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London, as it‚Äôs truly a memorable spot that combines elegance, tradition, and culinary excellence."
The Wolseley,2.0,"Inattentive staff. Did not refill our glasses of water for over 20 minutes. Admittedly they ignored us for everything else as well. The scones were blah, the jam tasted like nothing. I don't know what's in the chocolate cake, but no thanks. And please don't add a ¬£13.95 ""service fee"" onto the bill before anything is delivered to our table. What IS that? If I want to be tricked into tipping, I'll head back to the States.

Also, turn some lights on in the toilets. I thought I was locked in and nearly had a panic attack."
The Wolseley,4.0,"I‚Äôm very partial to the Wolseley no matter what they say and through how many hands it passes down. They have a robust wine list still and their breakfast are a still a number. They are probably one of the few in London that still understand the ways and means of a Ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel. Gigondas - my favourite from the list of all reds - you‚Äôll find here. They‚Äôll give you some nibbles out of courtesy and good taste and despite closing nearing, they‚Äôll not rush you. Soutine from the same brand had it from a different Ch√¢teau, but off the menu. Probably Colbert has one of it now but I‚Äôm a Bermondsey Soho relevant, so can‚Äôt be bothered to travel."
The Wolseley,3.0,"We went there for afternoon tea.  The food was good enough, this is a general comment on afternoon tea. I never understood the appeal for cucumber sandwiches or any of those sanswiches.  I much prefer the cakes and scones.

We can't fault the atmosphere and service.  There were 5 stars.

By all means go there for an experience but food is over hyped."
The Wolseley,4.0,"Great cafe. I went there for breakfast and was greeted by friendly and attentive staff throughout the meal. Ordered the eggs Benedict which was delicious. I also ordered a pain au chocolat, it was very nice, however would have liked option to be warmed. The cappuccino I order wasn‚Äôt great coffee which was a shame."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Amazing food, even better service, now this place is class. The simple scrabbled egg on sour dough toasted bread, which I order before the French Toast, regularly. if you read my reviews regularly you know why! It was tremendous, you just taste the soft, buttery, creamy, luxuriously simple scrambled eggs wonderfully toasted with sour dough one of the best scrabbled eggs on toast I‚Äôve had. Left me speechless. Now the French Toast woaw again these top places, it had the perfect balance came with berries some jam not to sweet and maple syrup that topped of a great breakfast. Busy breakfast day very popular place but while still feeling a sense of privacy liked it a lot my sort of place perfect London atmosphere, reserve."
The Wolseley,4.0,"A beautiful restaurant located in the vibrant, busy & lively Piccadilly! We stopped to take our chances to find a table and managed to snag the small round 2-top tucked away in the window nook near the host area. It was jam packed and service was understandably tough to get. I ordered a beer and the wife ordered tea. Everything good but would have loved to stay for a proper dinner at a (bigger) table. Next time - reservations!"
The Wolseley,5.0,"A glamorous spot for a special breakfast, brunch or lunch.
Staff are friendly and relaxed, service superb,
The surroundings make for a visit to remember if it's a treat, recommend booking ahead or the wait times can be lengthy at the door.
Simply one of the best spots in town for a special occasion."
The Wolseley,4.0,"Always found a table without reservation, try your luck and be kind. The table will eventually appear. Thank you for hosting me on various occasion but especially thank you for having me yesterday when I looked a real mess straight out of the airport after 15 days of backpacking throughout Italy . The guy at the front desk was extremely courteous. For those claiming this place is filled with rude and stuck up personnel, you clearly got an inferiority complex."
The Wolseley,3.0,"A nice restaurant but quite overhyped.

We were expecting a bit more from the food and whilst they all tasted good... that's it. Just good. Nothing special or amazing that would make us want to return regularly.

The veal chop in particular was tasty but so salty that you end up drinking lots of water for the rest of the night.

The desserts we tried are, again...just OK.
I know it's a popular place and you can tell by how busy it always gets but we just don't see what the big deal is.

The service was very good, in theme with the traditional vibe of the establishment.

The atmosphere itself felt quite similar to a typical pub. Very very loud and you get to smell all of your neighbours' dishes as soon as you enter through the door. There's no sense of intimacy or class, as you'd expect.

In our opinion, it also looks a lot better in the photos than in real life.

Overall we were quite disappointed and will not be returning here for the foreseeable future.

The bill (inc. service charge) came to ¬£224 for the two of us. You can double this if you like to drink."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Food 10/10
Service 10/10
Atmosphere 10/10
we we there for a birthday dinner
Personal welcomed us saying happy birthday which is a nice gesture :)
Overall must seen London place"
The Wolseley,5.0,Breakfast @ The Wolseley was delicious and fancy.  A great way to start the day!  I recommend the Crispy Bacon Wrap with the Fried Egg
The Wolseley,3.0,"This used to be the iconic place to go and always fully booked. I was surprised to get a table at short notice. Now I know why. Service wasn't good compared to all other visits over last 10 years, food was average compared to fantastic as it used to be and it was empty by 9pm. Sad to see its decline."
The Wolseley,5.0,Wonderful experience visiting . I had the champagne afternoon tea for my birthday. Great service . Could not fault it
The Wolseley,4.0,"We've been to The Wolseley several times to enjoy both the experience and the food. It's always a lovely place to visit due to the excellent and attentive staff who make every guest feel special. The location itself on Piccadilly also helps as it's quite dramatic and feels nothing like a car showroom!

The food in this grand caf√© is also memorable with dishes ranging from scallops to steaks and everything in between. We certainly enjoyed our brunch although our teenage children were less impressed. Perhaps the meals on offer are best appreciated by an older clientele?

The only downside is that you can definitely feel the effects of wage and food inflation when you come to pay. We ended up spending over ¬£300 for five people (with no alcohol) which is not something that you can do everyday. So come to The Wolseley for the special occasion and you shouldn't be disappointed."
The Wolseley,4.0,It was the best place to experience British creamy culture. I think it would be good to make a reservation and the staff was friendly. The interior was very delicious and I was able to have a good time thanks to it.
The Wolseley,4.0,"We wanted to try the afternoon tea once in London in a fancy setting without making a hole in our pocket so tried the Wolseley. Much to our surprise they let us share it, so at $50 for 2 ppl it felt like a deal. While the restaurant decor itself is stunning, the food was a mixed bag. We ordered the Vegetarian Afternoon Tea and loved the sandwiches. The tea and scones were also decent but the pastries were just average. Overall a good experience for the price."
The Wolseley,5.0,"This restaurant exudes elegance and sophistication, with its beautifully arched ceilings and opulent interior design. The ambiance is both warm and refined, making it an ideal setting for a memorable dining experience. The attention to detail in both the decor and the service is evident, creating an atmosphere that is both inviting and luxurious. Whether you're enjoying a meal or simply soaking in the surroundings, this restaurant offers a perfect blend of comfort and class."
The Wolseley,4.0,"Our waiter was perfectly nice but one of the waitresses was quite off. Not enough Staff as we didn't get our water topped up even once.

Food was good. Great menu choice.
Prices were reasonable too. I would certainly go again."
The Wolseley,5.0,"This was a great place to have a traditional English Tea. It's a big place and it can be noisy (so you may not want to come here if you want a quiet place for tea), but yet the atmosphere just works for a taste of the hustle and bustle of London. The place had that classic feel that you want when in central London. The food was excellent and would definitely come back. The service was amazing as well."
The Wolseley,5.0,"This is a beautiful restaurant that is fitting for a business lunch, romantic dinner, or just a desire to try high-end local, British cuisine. The menu was expansive, with options for any diet, and everything was delicious. We went for dinner but they also have an afternoon tea. Highly recommend reservations and getting a drink at the bar while you wait."
The Wolseley,4.0,"+ An expensive breakfast, but worth the experience. A renowned caf√®-restaurant located in a prime location. Sophisticated dining in a beautiful setting, with good service. A nice treat.

- The English breakfast could have included a piece of toast at least for the price paid, rather than being an extra, charged, add on :/"
The Wolseley,5.0,"Booked the Wolseley via OpenTable as it worked out best for us .
Lunch was marvellous the ambiance is terrific such history in a building.i will try time dependent go again and again .
For food advise always read the website for the latest menu and advise."
The Wolseley,5.0,"I visited The Wolseley for cream tea without a reservation. Despite it being fully booked, Katrina was kind enough to arrange a wonderful seat for us with a stunning view of the restaurant. We were served by Yash, who treated us with exceptional respect and kindness. As tourists, we truly appreciated his warm hospitality. The scones were delightful, and the vanilla iced latte was fantastic. I would definitely return on my next visit to London."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Delicious food, beautiful location and excellent service. Make sure to book if you want to be certain of a table, they are always busy. That also makes for a good atmosphere - the low buzz of chatter."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Beautiful afternoon teas. I love their spread, and they definitely serve one my favourite sandwiches in London. Would recommend."
The Wolseley,4.0,"We had a pleasant dining experience at The Wolseley in London. The ambiance was elegant and inviting, and the staff were attentive and courteous. We ordered a three-course meal, and while the food was good, it didn‚Äôt quite hit the exceptional mark for us. Overall, it was a solid 4 out of 5, and we would consider visiting again for the lovely atmosphere and service.

The Wolseley,5.0,"Such a posh place. That used to be a Chinese restraint before, and so great that they keep some fragments from the past! I really enjoyed food & dessert in the company of my friends. Great place to be!"
The Wolseley,5.0,I had the salad ni√ßoise and cream tea. The scones are absolutely divine.
The Wolseley,4.0,"I've been going to the Wolseley for years and love the theatre of it. It's always exciting to be there and I have generally eaten well. However the superfood salad is more a form of punishment than a pleasure and they really have to rethink it. If I fancy a healthy salad it's not because I want to suffer. I still need something delicious. Kale and couscous doesn't do it. Come on guys, you can do better."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Just had a really splendid all out birthday afternoon tea at the Wolseley (my Top Tip - eat as little as you can for 24 h beforehand to do full justice to this menu!).

Some beautifully executed food, including a fantastic twist - their London Rarebit adds top quality bacon & soft yolked egg to the toasted cheesy sourdoughy magnificence of a Welsh Rarebit. Absolutely delicious. Plus one of the nicest hot chocolates I have ever had (and have done some extensive testing over my life!).

Best of all was the beautiful service from our lovely waiter Ian. One of my dining out benchmarks is whether people pay attention when I ask for the really icy water I adore. Ian brought me my very own well laden silver ice bucket and tongs - superlative! A highly capable, nice and kind man, nothing too much trouble and almost everything already quietly provided before we even knew we wanted them.

Also a very beautiful environment to dine in.

Thanks for a wonderful birthday treat - we are already planning our return in the New Year!"
The Wolseley,3.0,"Since it was our first time in the UK, we felt that trying the famous afternoon tea was a must. However, the experience fell short of our expectations in several aspects‚Äîfood, tea, service, and atmosphere.

Starting with the food, it was decent but not particularly memorable. We had seen reviews mentioning unlimited servings, but that wasn‚Äôt the case for us. The selection included sandwiches, scones, and a few desserts, along with a single pot of tea without refills. The scones were fine‚Äîperhaps slightly better than what you‚Äôd find at Starbucks‚Äîbut nothing exceptional. The sandwiches were underwhelming, and while the desserts were enjoyable, they weren‚Äôt particularly impressive.

As for the service, there wasn‚Äôt much to comment on, as it was practically nonexistent. Since we‚Äôre in Europe, we didn‚Äôt have high expectations for service, so this aspect wasn‚Äôt particularly surprising.

The biggest letdown, however, was the atmosphere. The space was incredibly crowded, with tables placed so closely together that it was difficult to have a conversation without overhearing those around us. We were also seated at the very back, which didn‚Äôt contribute to a particularly pleasant experience.

That said, given the price point, this was one of the more affordable ‚Äúluxury‚Äù afternoon tea options in London. While we had hoped for a more enjoyable experience, we recognize that it offered a relatively accessible way to try this tradition. However, considering the overall quality of the food, setting, and service, it didn‚Äôt feel like great value for money. Overall, we‚Äôd give it three stars."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Went today for my birthday breakfast which was (as usual ) - amazing! The service is fantastic & special shout out to Claudia , who was lovely-
Many thanks for my birthday donut - lovely surprise!"
The Wolseley,2.0,"A great and cozy establishment with beautiful decor. Booked for high-tea on the weekday at 4pm, table wasn't ready. Not a great start but an understandable circumstance. Food was honestly average at best. Jasmine tea was over brewed and insanely bitter, tea strainer was still dirty. Sandwiches were nice, sweet treats were not great. Cheesecake was not smooth, cakes were overly sweet from icing sugar and strawberries were sour. Scones were great though!

Service wasn't anything great nor bad, just looked tired and needed a mood boost..

Overall quite a disappointing visit, would stay away from The Wolseley for a good afternoon tea experience."
The Wolseley,5.0,"Such a wonderful and fancy place to have a breakfast,brunch or afternoon tea as well. It‚Äôs not my first time here and for sure not the last.
The service is perfect all the staff are amazing and so respectful, your order will be ready in few minutes.
The place and atmosphere is incredible including the decoration.
For sure you should try the pancake, French toast and Mashed Avocado with Confit Tomato on Wholemeal Toast. I got an americano and hot chocolate for drinks and it was all amazing."
The Wolseley,4.0,"Not bad.  But not the best food I've had for the price.

Escargot we're good size but lacked flavour.  The fruit de mere had sand in the clams. Quite gritty but sauce was nice"
The Wolseley,4.0,"Loved the Wolseley. It was absolutely packed yet the service remained on point. We had a lovely waitress who was attentive, really lovely and friendly.

Our food was delicious especially the Hake. Rated 4 stars though because the Flat Iron Steak was a rather chewy and bland in flavour,  the new potatoes were way too salty and the green beans a bit too overcooked so slightly on the mushy side!.

However the rest of the meal was lovely. We had goats cheese & asparagus tart and ham hock terrine to start. Complimentary bread with the best most delicious butter!! The Hake was fish of the day and beautifully cooked and served on stunning mushroom base. Couldn‚Äôt fit in a dessert but we were surprised with amazing macarons as a complimentary anniversary treat. Would definitely go again. ¬£140  (2 starters 2 mains 2 cokes pot of tea double espresso and service charge)"
The Wolseley,5.0,Delicious food & drinks and nice atmosphere. Best macrons I‚Äôve ever had!
The Wolseley,5.0,Perfect setting. Great service. Really good food.

Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Mielo ‚Äì Mediterranean Excellence & Warm Hospitality!!!

What an incredible experience at Mielo this late afternoon! We tried the goat cheese salad ‚Äì full of hearty, rich flavor ‚Äì along with the burrata salad and their warm bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. The ingredients were fresh, the presentation elegant, and the flavors perfectly balanced.

Both dishes, along with sparkling water, came to just ¬£40 ‚Äì excellent value for money considering the quality and generous portions.

The staff were professional and genuinely friendly. They gave us space to enjoy our meal without hovering or pushing us to order more, which made the whole experience even more relaxing and enjoyable.

Mielo truly captures the spirit of Mediterranean hospitality."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Been here a few times. Food was always great and service was even better. Was there with some friends and two babies for brunch - the staff were all so friendly and helpful with the kids. Even gave the babies fresh fruits for snacks without us asking. Definitely 5 star experience. The only suggestion is that they should probably think about having more than one high chair üôà it‚Äôs such a great restaurant with nice setting and enough space for small and bigger groups. Plenty of space for buggies (what mummies love). Will definitely come back

We had a stunning lunch. Beautiful Seabass ceviche, followed by Zucchini fritters and then Saut√© scallops. All were cooked perfectly. The chefs are doing a great job and are being supported by friendly and professional front of house. We loved our lunch.
You can go here with confidence."

Everything was absolutely amazing from entering and leaving the restaurant
Food was delicious üëåüèª

The staff were very professional,  which made the whole experience even more relaxing and enjoyable.

Would definitely come back again!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Booked Mielo for an ‚Äúearly bird‚Äù supper (or a very late lunch) before going to see a show. We went for the lunch/early evening set course menu & had two courses for ¬£25 each. I was expecting the portions to be a bit smaller because we went for the set menu but I was wrong, they were really generous! The food was delicious and very flavourful. The service was lovely, very attentive and friendly. One of the staff even chased after us after we left to give us complimentary after dinner sweets. The atmosphere was relaxed and the interior was stylish. Top marks for the great music too! Would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for good food at a decent price in central London that isn‚Äôt a tourist trap."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Salmon tartare is on spot. Quite salty to my friend‚Äôs taste but to me it was nice. The arancini is nice, everyone was recommending it but I think it tastes like a good beef ball. Squid linguini is the best so far. Complete in love with it. Chicken on quinoa salad is fresh, flavourful and crunchy. Steak was quite dry, the beetroot paste tastes weirdly nice. A good experience overall."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"What a lovely restaurant! Went yesterday with a few friends, service was excellent, food was absolutely delicious and such a lovely atmosphere, with live music and some great songs! I will absolutely be returning again."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Mediterranean restaurant. A bit confused menu. Some dishes were ok  and some were outstanding.  4 out of 5. Octopus was really good and soft.  Staff were amazing,  especially the managerss who responded to our reviews, took it to her heart to improve our experience and recommended and gave us the best dessert on the house favourite was Le Fondant au chocolat and lemoncello. Because of the managerss wonderful service I will definitely go back again. Uplifted the rating from 3 to 4 and 5 for service.  Please try"
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"I wouldn't say I was overly impressed, but nevertheless it was good food with good service. I think what spoiled it was how noisy it was, not with people but the live musicians in the corner. Too loud, which meant everyone was talking loudly and we on our table were struggling to enjoy a conversation.

Food was good, but not wow. I've had better.
Great selection of spirits and wines.

A lot of the menu I thought was over priced for what it was. Some was fair.
The 15% service charge was a bit much, considering the atmosphere was too busy.
Charging ¬£6 for a bottle of water cost ¬£30! So ended up paying over ¬£100 just in service charge and water! That I was not impressed with.

I did enjoy the evening and food was good, but unfortunately not worth 5 stars."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Very nice restaurant, very elegant vibes. The prices are okay sincer we are on a pretty important street. The bread we got in the beginning is to die for, really good. The entire food is exceptional. And the staff really nice."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"This is a great restaurant all around. Delicious food. Beautiful facilities, pleasant music. Good service. We went on Easter Sunday had the chicken and lamb shank it was delicious! Good menu, plenty of choice. Would highly recommend it."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"My wife and I had a wonderful meal at Mielo last night! The food was delicious. In particular the octopus was very tender and all of the meat was high quality. Thank you to Engin and his team, especially the Manager and Jericho for looking after us so well. The restaurant had a lovely atmosphere with nice live background music playing. Would highly recommend!"
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"We visited Mielo as a group of 12 for a Christmas gathering and had a good experience overall. The service was attentive, and the staff made sure we were well looked after.

I ordered the lamb loin, which was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the accompanying vegetables and sauce. However, the portion size was smaller than expected, and I had to order an extra side. The garlic mushrooms were tasty but quite expensive at ¬£6 for a small portion.

While the food and atmosphere were enjoyable, the pricing felt a bit high for the portion sizes. Still, it‚Äôs a good spot for a special occasion, especially if you don‚Äôt mind splurging a little.

A nice touch was the small box of chocolates we received at the end which added to the festive feel."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Wonderful experience at Mielo. Food was tasty fresh and prepared with care. Service was attentive and friendly. Recommend the Sherlock Holmes cocktail and both dishes you see pictured
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Niko and JD was the perfect additions to our delightful evening. They were funny, helpful and such a nice guys. The food was perfect and the service provided by Niko was something else. One of the best night i‚Äôve had in a long time just because of our waiter and now friend Niko."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,It‚Äôs more of a 4.3 for me but limited by the rating system. The overall ambiance and food quality was good although not quite a 5. We loved how dog friendly they are and we were able to sit inside by the window with our dog. We really liked the mezze platter which was a highlight for us. The garlic shrimp was least impressive but the lamb shank and sliced aubergine was good (just not great). Overall a solid experience and would recommend if you‚Äôre in the area
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic experience from professional service, absolutely delicious food to lovely vide. I can‚Äôt recommend this place  enough. London must try!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in London. The food was exceptional, the starters, mains and desserts were all elite. I found it really difficult to find something to pick at. The seating was gorgeous and importantly in London, spacious. It was a packed and busy evening and with both tables beside us full, I couldn‚Äôt have been more comfortable. The staff are incredibly polite and attentive, making sure our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed at all times. On the way out we were even gifted these little boxes filled with amazing chocolate almonds. Really great experience, highly recommended and I will definitely be revisiting again when in the mood for top tier Mediterranean food."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Had the two-course set menu‚Äîdelicious food, quick service, and a beautiful restaurant!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing place, very nice staff and food is stunningly good. Special mention to the cocktail bar, especially the spicy margarita."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Came here on a Wednesday lunchtime and this is not my first time at Mielo. The food is amazing and the lunch menu is such great value. I had zucchini fitters to start followed by grilled salmon and it was just the best. We were served by Evita who was an absolute star. The staff are so attentive and polite. One of my favourite restaurants in London.
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic food and reasonably priced in the heart of London. Splendid service and great hospitality. Many thanks to Garry, very polite and quick response, always ready to attend to customers. Will definitely come back again if I come to London"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"The service is top notch and very friendly. I love the menu and the foods as well. Very child friendly placeüëåüèª This is our second year and we went there two times. As a foodie having michelin started food elsewhere, I think the cod will get at least 1 star. It has all the flavors, perfect!!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Food was amazing, on the table in less than 5 minutes, portions were great and well priced."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,In for a treat - everything was just perfect. I wasn‚Äôt expecting live music on my Saturday night visit - but was really pleasantly surprised by my choice. Lamb was very juicy and tender. Would also recommend our choice of starters - rice ball and prawn skewers. Will skip dessert though.
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"I don‚Äôt often give 5 start however I feel this place deserves it. I loved my experience from beginning to end. Staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating. The restaurant is decorated beautifully I can imagine it to be lovely place to come in the summer as they have some outdoor seating. I visited to celebrate my nieces birthday with family. Everyone enjoyed the food, I tried things I would not normally go for and I was not disappointed. There is great options for non meat eaters which was appreciated with our party. I had a fabulous cocktail called ‚ÄúZilli‚Äù it was so good that I would come back just for that cocktail. I also really enjoyed the asparagus salad which is not something I would normally go for but very impressive. I cannot end this review without mention the bread for the table, I believe it was complimentary however it was soo delicious and fresh! We also brought our own birthday cake which was not a problem, they bought it out with plates and napkins for us to serve ourselves. Overall great experience and I would 100% recommend and I also cannot wait to return."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Came here for lunch after realising that Wulf and Lamb next door closed permanently. While not a vegan restaurant it does decent have vegetarian options.

This time I felt like eating seafood for starters and ordered two right away: king prawns and scallops. Both were delicious. The complimentary bread is terrific and I really liked the fact that they mixed olive oil with balsamic vinegar to accompany it (nice touch!).

Finished with the mushroom risotto as my main course. Great experience with a very attentive staff. Would recommend to anyone!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"It was such a nice surprise! Menu sounded good. But experiencing it was a complete different story. We were not expecting such good quality of ingredients, which made the culinary experience so satisfying. Staff is super nice and professional they treated us so well even when we entered looking like hungry poor turists. I will never forget how accommodating they were with us and even gave us a complementary chocolate at the end. Everything was perfect in this culinary experience. The lamb shank is to die for."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Excellent restaurant, well cooked, hot food with attentive but discrete service.  Also had live music, two solo singers alternating, both very good and the music at a level where you could hear it easily but it did not interrupt conversation.

Final bill was around ¬£45/person including drinks which for the quality and it being London was good value.  Would definitely go back.  Thanks for a lovely evening."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Foods and services are nice! especially the rice ball and spaghetti we tried! The lamb chop was okay, not particularly like the seasoning, and kinda hope it‚Äôd be a bit softer."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Flew to London for 3 days. Ate here twice! One of the best restaurants in London. You must come here even if it‚Äôs just for the bread!
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"What a surprise to have such amazing service in London, this place was outstanding. The food was fantastic and my friend and I had a wonderful evening together sharing wine and having some lovely food. We sat outside and the weather was great and the servers very attentive."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Booked through the Fork website and got 30% off on the food bill. Comfortable and spacious seating. Friendly service. Food was good but I wasn't overly impressed by the flavour overall.

Before our meal, they served some complementary bread with olives and their house special avo hummus. I loved the hummus, it tasted very fresh. The bread was interesting though, it was more like a pizza dough baked with spices on top. It was delicious.

For starters, we ordered smoked aubergine ravioli and arancinis.

I wasn't a big fan of the ravioli as the pasta was a little too thick and tasted overcooked. The smoked aubergine filling was good, so more of these wrapped with a thinner pasta would be good. The ravioli sauce was quite thick and I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a sauce or a cream soup? Flavour was good but again, not sure if this goes with the raviolis themselves.

The arancinis were served lukewarm and were small. Although the flavour and the crunch were there, I would've preferred them to be served hot with more meat fillings.

Coming onto the main course, we had the Mediterranean lamb shank and salmon.

I liked the lamb shank, though not exactly what I expected as it's more like a curry lamb shank. In general, the meat comes off the bone but not the parts closer to the bone. I loved the mashed potatoes! I don't know what they did but the texture was better than a standard mash. Overall a good dish.

The salmon was seasoned well and goes well with the refreshing sauce. I thought it may be slightly overcooked because the centre was not as tender as I like.

For some reason, they gave us a free tiramisu at the end which was a pleasant surprise! Thank you!

The meal experience was largely good. We were sat next to the bar area and it was very noisy at times when the bartender was making drinks.

Overall, I think it's a pretty good restaurant but I'm not sure I would pay full price to dine here. For me, the food has to be outstanding for this price range."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"We came during their slow time. The food was okay, not impressed, not really wow you, but also not disappointed you."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"One of the best places I've been to in London.  Mielo stands out for all aspects: mouth-watering flavours in all dishes offered; significantly delicious dessert and extremely friendly staff. Special thanks to Nicol. Seabass with white wine and lemon sauce, chicken fillet and ink linguini are highly recommended üëå"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic place and service, really good place to dine üçΩ. Coming again this Friday, 23rd of may to celebrate ü•≥ a friend birthday üéÇ. ELIAS"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"I visited alone on a Monday without a reservation. I ordered the 2-course lunch menu for ¬£25 and a glass of white wine. Among all the restaurants I visited during my four-day stay in London, this place provided the most satisfying experience in terms of food quality, service, cleanliness, and atmosphere.

The asparagus salad was the best asparagus dish I‚Äôve ever had (too bad i forgot to take a picture), and the squid ink linguine was loaded with seafood and perfectly seasoned, not overly salty. Even the bread and olive oil served before the meal were delicious! I could tell it was a quality olive oil. ÌïúÍµ≠Ïù∏Îì§ ÏûÖÎßõÏóêÎèÑ Ïûò ÎßûÏùÑ Í≤É Í∞ôÏïÑÏöî!

A special thanks to the male server who recommended a South African white wine that paired perfectly with the dishes. After expressing my appreciation, he kindly shared some tips on choosing white wine and even let me taste an excellent Pinot Noir, saying I might like it. It was truly an enjoyable experience. The female server was also very professional and friendly. Her menu recommendation was also spot on.
If you‚Äôre looking for a restaurant near Marylebone, I highly recommend this place."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"We had a spectacular time at Miele on Sunday evening. We were early for our reservation, they took us no problem. Our server was a wonderful young woman who made sound suggestions and was super attentive. The food - awesome! Our table started with scallops, pedron peppers, both wonderful and cooked on point. Then we moved to the asparagus mushroom risotto, the cauliflower steak and octopus (with an added salad since this is a starter). We finished off with tiramisu and the pistachio almond cake. We raved about our meals all the way home. Of course, our server couldn‚Äôt  let us leave without our beautiful little box of chocolate truffles. The attention to detail is bar none the best I‚Äôve seen in a long time. Mielo comes highly recommended from this girl!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"The steak, lamb, and recommended wine were all delicious. I especially enjoyed the spinach I ordered as a side with the steak; it was so good that I ended up ordering another serving."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"I cannot praise this Restaurant enough. I visit this restaurant regularly but normally with a couple of friends and it is normally my number one choice in the area. Last Tuesday we had a leaving do and 24 people were present. I was a bit nervous because I wanted everything to be perfect and they did not fail me. They set up a beautiful table for 24 people, the atmosphere was so warm and vibrant, the food was excellent with fresh ingredients and the service was exceptional. We agreed to have each one a separate bill, Nico did it with no sweat, he remembered what each has ordered. Nico and Rogerta (manager) I can‚Äôt thank you enough for a beautiful evening you have managed so well. You are really super stars."
Mielo Restaurant,3.0,"Some hits and some misses on the dishes. Octopus and linguine dishes were overcooked. The rest were good, although ALL the desserts we ordered did not hit the mark. The chocolate fondant was overcooked and crispy on the edges, the pistachio cake was dry like it had been sitting there for days and the tiramisu lacked flavour."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"You can enjoy the wonderful service of the staff and fusion Mediterranean cuisine that you have never tasted before. I used this restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday. I highly recommend it. One pleasant surprise was that the portions were large, so please be aware of that."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,The food was great. The lamb shank and the squid pasts were something else. But what makes this even more of an experience is the service. The lady serving us was helpful and always wore a smile.
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Amazing food and atmosphere, very nice staff and very caring. We have great memories to cherish from here. We could actually talk and didn‚Äôt have to shout, we felt really comfortable and not crammed. The starters on the house were a great surprise and something not very common in London especially the amount. Even the chefs smiled and waved goodbye as we walked out. Will return in the future, thanks for helping us create great memories :). PS the lava cake served to me as birthday surprise was absolutely amazing, I woke up craving it‚Ä¶"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely delightful dining experience! The food here is incredibly tasty, with each dish bursting with flavors that linger on the palate. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff is attentive and friendly, making the whole evening enjoyable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great meal in a pleasant setting."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"This was easily the best meal of our two week vacation. Every course, every single dish was flawless. The service elevated the experience and was exceptional. The cocktails perfection. I‚Äôm running out of superlatives. I left very, happily, full and will remember this meal and the service for a long time. What a way to end a trip!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Had a wonderful dinner. Started with the eggplant caviar, the seasoning and sauces made it the best dish of its kind I‚Äôve tasted. The spinach frittata was simple but good, maybe something else to spice it up. Our mains were each superb, 3 meaty lamb chops perfectly seasoned and grilled, and dark meat chicken kabobs so good you could eat them w/o the wonderful tzatziki dip. Do both. Sides were perfect roast potatoes and what they called Greek salad, but was really horitaki - excellent. Service impeccable. Atmosphere with the live music and comfortable seating outstanding. Glad we chose this as one of our 5 dinner locations."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Great experience- food was very very good, the waiters were super nice and very attentive. Price wise, very reasonable! I am very happy with my experience in the restaurant and do recommend it  üôå"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"We had a really nice early dinner here on a Thursday. As a relatively large group we felt very well looked after, drinks were great, starters were lovely and mains were also very good. The restaurant had a good ambience, staff were very friendly and accommodating and we had a fantastic experience."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Perfection! Stopped by on a sunny day, managed to grab a gorgeous table outside, in the shade people watching busy central London. Service was exceptional, warm, friendly and welcoming. I went for the set lunch menu which was decent price (25 for 2 courses) and for what you got was very impressive. Complimentary flatbread whilst I waited. Prawns were delish & the squid ink pasta was stunning. HUGE portions. Couldn't recommend this place more for a cheapish lunch set menu. Will definitely be back."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Had a lovely dinner for two at Mielo. The food was excellent, the ambience had a special charm, and our server Garry was both friendly and professional. Great experience all around‚Äîthank you, Mielo! üçØ"
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"A trendy brunch place in Marylebone!

Since we were not too hungry, we ordered 2 of the small sharing plates and 1 main. Our order came with a complementary side of warm bread and olives which were very tasty and soft.

The two appetisers were good, the fried lasagna could do with a bit more seasoning and fillings and a the lasagna sheets could be a bit thinner for a much better mouth feel in my opinion. The fried filo was extremely delicious and it tasted just as expected, the sweet chilli sauce provided was nice but unnecessary since I feel as though it took away the rich flavours of the cheese and the fillings a little too much.

We had the lamb shank for the main course. The meat was super tender whilst the mash potato and sauce had a rich flavour. The sauce tasted similar to a south east asian lamb curry which I really enjoyed. The meat itself could use with a little more seasoning, but when eaten with the sauce and mash it was perfect, so maybe it was intentional.

Overall, the food was good and the place and service was nice."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Not 4.9

Mielo offers a comforting, homestyle dining experience. The octopus starter was exceptional, but the ravioli needed more cooking. The lamb shank is highly recommended, flavorful and tender. The sea bass was decent, though not remarkable. The ambiance is akin to a cozy home kitchen, with simple plate presentation and a casual service style. However, considering the simplicity of the dishes, the prices felt a bit steep. Ideal for those seeking a cozy meal but be prepared for a slightly higher cost for the home-cooked feel."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Meilo Restaurant at 39 Paddington Street is an absolute delight for anyone who loves Mediterranean cuisine.
The ambiance is cozy and inviting, perfect for both casual dining and special occasions.
The menu features an impressive selection of dishes, all prepared with fresh ingredients and authentic flavors.

The staff speciallyMr. Niko  at Meilo are incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring a top-notch dining experience from start to finish. The highlights of my visit included the perfectly cooked lamb kebabs and the fresh, vibrant Greek salad. The baklava dessert was the perfect sweet ending to a fantastic meal.

If you‚Äôre in London and craving Mediterranean food, Meilo Restaurant is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely love this restaurant! They always go above and beyond to give excellent customer service. They give free bread (and it‚Äôs nice and toasted) with oil and balsamic, and the main portions are huge! They also do a great two or three course deal. My mum is celiac and they kindly gave her gluten free bread and said they could make anything from the menu gluten free!"
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,Went here for brunch. We had booked but actually the place was empty enough to walk-in. Service was very nice and the food was great (good portions and swaps were catered for). Not a fan of the decor but besides that good experience overall!
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,One of the best restaurants that I‚Äôve been to in London. The food was absolutely amazing and we got excellent service by the waiter Jake ‚ú®.
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Had the most wonderful dining experience! Not only is the aesthetic beautiful, the food was also delicious. We started of with the Zucchini Fritters, Fried Albarino Rice Balls and Octopus (something new for us, certainly did not disappoint), everything was beautifully seasoned and fresh. We went on to have lamb chops and chicken skewers which were succulent and beautifully presented. The San Sebastian cheesecake was the star of the show! Absolutely divine.

Not only was the food beautiful the staff were also wonderful. Engin made us feel so special along with all the attentive waiters/waitresses and amazing chefs! A must visit in London."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Mediterranean restaurant with a good atmosphere. Live music was great and service was really efficient. Nice decor as well. My main issue was the food being so inconsistent.

The Squid Ink pasta was really good and our favorite dish but the burrata was very average, the beef carpaccio was okay but the portion was so small for the price! We usually get served double that portion for the same price. All of our other dishes were okay but not great and very expensive for this quality."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Had items on the 3 course lunch menu - all the items were excellent. The squid ink pasta  and tarte tatin were exceptionally good. Portions are generous. Service was good too.
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Stylish restaurant, with accomplished deco. The dark blue ceiling doesn't make it oppressive due to the use of bold and bright colours and fabrics elsewhere. Classy but relaxed. More a 4.5*

They start you off with complimentary olives, bread and avocado humus, the latter particularly tasty.
I had the tenderised grilled octopus as starter. Beatifully cooked and presented. Lamb loin fillet as a main, served on a bed of vegetables. Delicious, again perfectly cooked and presented and the sauce rich but not overpowering. A very accomplished dish.
Dessert San Sebastian cake with warm chocolate, good but could have been better. I guess expectations were very high after the first two courses...

It was unexpectedly busy on a Monday evening end of last month, perhaps with people taking advantage of The Fork offer!
The atmosphere is lively but allows for intimacy, and both groups and couples can feel very comfortable. The background music was good as well, not too loud to allow conversation without having to shout.
As for service, it was super attentive and relaxed. All staff very welcoming and helpful. They definitely get a 5* from me.

In brief, lovely restaurant, with good quality food, beautifully cooked and presented. And the service is excellent. Highly recommended!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Some friends recommended the restaurant, and it was up to our expectation. We had a good time with good music. The food was great ( the slow cooked lamb is delicious ) and the service was nice !"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Stopped here on my way back from the Warner bros studio tour. Decided to get off at baker street and explore rather than going to Victoria station. A good move by accident as I found this gem of a place for dinner. Rashid, our waiter was amazing and paid attention to every detail. Food right from the starter to the dessert was excellent. The atmosphere is very cozy and upscale. Do stop by if you are in the neighborhood. You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Visiting Mielo restaurant with my family on my son'
birthday to enjoy Mediterranean food was an amazing experience. Heart of London Baker Street well layouts bright and modern. The staff were incredibly friendly. Head chef especial dish was amazing.
We highly recommend this restaurant just try you will definitely collect some great memories from Mielo."
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Very good food. Multiple vegetarian options available, I recommend the grilled aubergine. The atmosphere was nice too. However, the service was a little slow, we had to wait more than 20 min between the first and second dish. The price is on the expensive side."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"We had a really lovely lunch at Mielo, the seared scallops are cooked to perfection, the courgette fitters are crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The burrara is oozy and melt in your mouth. The Arancini are so light it made a perfect starter. We really enjoyed the prawns and scallops squid ink pasta, the seafood was perfectly cooked and the scallops cannot be fresher.
Even smaller dishes like the grilled asparagus were perfectly seasoned, we finished the meal with the rice pudding flavoured with orange zest, what a lovely touch!

The service is prompt, friendly and attentive. Last but certainly not least, I like the decor and ambience of Mielo, it‚Äôs stylish and full of life. Will definitely come back."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"wonderful restaurant with deliciously prepared and beautifully presented dishes. I loved their lamb, their ceviche and the cocktails are amazing too! polite and very attentive staff, especially the young man who seated us. I definitely recommend Mielo."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"I‚Äôm celiac and had the most exquisite experience here!!! The service from every person I interacted with was top tier. They had so many options for me, made sure everything was double checked in the kitchen as gluten free, and even sent out complimentary gluten free bread toasted to perfection. I highly recommend the risotto, it blew my mind. I cannot wait to make a return visit next time I‚Äôm in London."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Hi jimmy. I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm too late
Thanks to you, We had very happy moment at lunch. We remember you and every staff. If I go back to London, I‚Äôll go to the restaurant and then I‚Äôd like to have another delicious dishes
Should be healthy until meet again"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Loved this place. It‚Äôs unpretentious really flavorful food. Great server who was very knowledgeable about how they cook things. My kind of healthy place to hang for a nice dinner without breaking the bank
Mielo Restaurant,4.0,"Given all of the 5* reviews, I feel like somewhat of an outlier with my 4* review (which would be 3.5 if that were possible), but for me the overall experience does not warrant 5* (or 4.9/5).

The service was generally very good but the atmosphere a little strange. Between 8pm and 10pm on a Tuesday night, the restaurant was, at its maximum, one quarter full. The music was initially quite loud, which, together with hard surfaces and a loud group of four nearby, made the noise quite unpleasant. Things improved to some extent, but it's not an especially relaxing room. It's also quite dark, even with the glass doors on the front side. The open kitchen was reasonably well-ventilated, but some grilling and frying smells drifted over.

The food was pretty good. The grilled lamb loin with 'healthy vegetables' wasn't quite as virtuous as it appeared, as the vegatables were ungenerous and there was a significant volume of unadvertised creamy sauce. It was well cooked, though, and the meat was decent enough. The chicken has unadvertised vegetables stuffed inside and was overcooked. The chips were disappointing - pale from undercooking, and underseasoned. The ultimate mezze was quite strange, in particular the cheese selection, which amongst others included two fruity English cheeses and what appeared to be marmite cheddar. They were incongruous with the rest of the mezze. The cured meat was not very nice, nor were the dolmades. All in all, despite the fancy plating and with the exception of the dips and bread, the mezze felt like an assembly of mediocre-quality supermarket ingredients.

After (politely) querying the thinking behind the cheese selection, the mezze was taken off the bill. We were also given a free dessert (which was good) and tea, because of our comically unstable table. To be fair to the staff, as soon as they noticed this, they offered to move us, which we declined.

I may return to try brunch offering, but would probably not go back for dinner."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Wow- What a great find today, while in London. If you haven‚Äôt tried this place , please do! You will not be disappointed! Fantastic!
SJ - California"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Beautiful decor & varied menu catering to a number of dietary needs. Food served in generous portions, loved the squid ink linguine with ample prawns & scallops. Cocktails could be a bit larger in volume but flavoursome overall."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Great warm atmosphere for a new year eve‚Äôs dinner. Food was nicely done and presented. Service team was professional, friendly and efficient."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"A last minute lunch with a friend visiting London for the day. One of the best fixed price lunches around. The dining room is comfortable, relaxed and spacious. The staff were friendly and attentive. The portions on the fixed lunch were generous to say the least (arguably too large!). If you're in the area then this is a must visit restaurant."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"We went here based on Google reviews, since we were closed by. Super right decision! The food is high quality and delicious. The staff were welcoming and friendly. We had a great time!"
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Nice space and very comfortable seating ( inside and outside). Had a very nice breakfast, creamy scrambled eggs and Damon with a touch of dill which made the extra difference. Excellent coffee, perfectly steamed milk on the latte and the espresso really balanced. Will re-visit for lunch / dinner. Service was very attentive and polite as well."
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,Really good food and even better service. We shared a few small plates and especially enjoyed the seabass ceviche. The waitress was never over bearing but always available when needed and added lots of little touches to make the visit great
Mielo Restaurant,5.0,"Great service and the food was tasty, the manager was really nice and professional with us, they also had live music on Saturday at 8:30. I recommend for a cosy romantic night and the tiramisu is a must try üòãüòã"
Faros Oxford Circus,,Óóä
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had an amazing evening at Faros in London! The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî the truffle pasta was rich, creamy, and packed with flavor, easily one of the best we‚Äôve ever had. The ravioli were equally impressive, perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients and the care put into each dish.

The drinks were also a highlight of the evening ‚Äî creative, well-balanced, and served with style. The atmosphere was warm and vibrant, and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

Faros exceeded our expectations in every way. We‚Äôll definitely be back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in London!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The atmosphere and the food were great. I especially recommend trying the risotto. The staff were warm and attentive, making us feel at home. Everyone was lovely, but with Ruby it felt like we had known each other for years. I can definitely recommend Faros with peace of mindüòç"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"5‚òÖ ‚Äì A great experience from A to Z!

Faros Restaurant is the perfect place if you are looking for excellent food, friendly service and a beautiful interior. The food was exceptionally tasty ‚Äì fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented.

The staff were very nice, professional and always smiling. The whole lunch went without a single mistake. The atmosphere is stylish yet cozy ‚Äì ideal for lunch with a partner or with friends.

I definitely recommend Faros to anyone who wants to enjoy great cuisine in the center of London. I will definitely be back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Traditional Italian cuisine. The pizza is made exactly right, with thin crust and soft cheese melting in your mouth, the pepperoni is good quality with strong flavor. The service is also impeccable- Ruby is very attentive. The atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic with good sound tracks in the background. We will definitely come back again."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had a lovely family dinner at Faros London this evening. Although there was a small issue during the meal, it was quickly addressed by the management in a professional and efficient manner. I truly appreciate how responsive and helpful the team was.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the overall service was great. Special thanks to the management and staff for turning things around so smoothly and making our family gathering a pleasant experience."
Faros Oxford Circus,2.0,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the experience at Faros. Me and my partner visited on a weekday lunch since it had a very high rating, and we wanted to try it out.

We had calamari fritti and octopus carpaccio for starters. Calamari was one of the toughest I've had. Octopus carpaccio had no flavour despite me trying desperately to get any flavour out of it. :D

The mains were better. Margherita pizza was nice, simple but tasty, with thin base. Seafood risotto had a big problem of tough seafood, not feeling fresh at all. Beef ragu pappardele was okay. Just expected deeper flavours with beef ragu cooked for 6 hours. Overall price and quality of food did not match.

Sitting space was very limited. We had a tiny table with barely enough space for 2 plates, cutlery, and glasses. In addition the table next to ours was very close. I was worried of smn sitting there since we would definitely have intervened in each other's spaces.

Service was good. However, I feel like the restaurant is trying to overcompensate poor food quality and high prices with overly attentive service."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Came to Faros in February. This is the best meal I‚Äôve ever had. Food was exceptional, and the staff were more than happy to give me as much basil as my heart desired (which is an absolutely obscene amount‚Äîmuch more basil was brought after this photo was taken). Service was incredible. Chef and his son are adorable. I wish I could eat at Faros every night. Every single course was a work of art. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Amazing restaurant. Super clean, food is fresh and delicious and our waitress Riya is just the sweetest person and offered excellent service. Definitely will be back."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our 51st anniversary at this wonderful restaurant,   the food variety and quality was outstanding.
The staff were very helpful and friendly, we were served by Asma and Ozzy, both were very professional and courteous.
We had a wonderful time in very elegant surroundings.
We highly recommend this restaurant, we will be back in the near future."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's so wise to choose this restaurant for your birthday this time! The moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was immediately drawn in by its warm and elegant atmosphere. The soft lighting and soothing music blend perfectly, and every corner is filled with a sense of ceremony. The dishes are delicious. Waiter Mehmet provided meticulous and measured service throughout the meal, always paying attention to the needs without disturbing the dining rhythm. I had unforgettable birthday memories here. Both the food and the service were impeccable. Highly recommended!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,We were hosted by Ozzy and his service was amazing. He was friendly as well as very attentive. Food was lovely. Thank you for creating such a memorable experience for us!
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Exceptional experience, the food was excellent the fresh truffle pasta was delicious, as were the other dishes the other guest had, our glasses were never empty. The staff were kind and accommodating, special thanks to Mehmet, the atmosphere was light and the decor and music was timeless. Great for a lunch dressed casually or a dinner dressed up. They also surprised us with a birthday cake and song, would recommend."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a great dinner at Faros! The Calamari Fritti was crispy and tender, and both the Risotto Mare and Linguine Allo Scoglio were rich and full of flavor ‚Äì we all loved it. Finished with a perfectly balanced Tiramisu, not too sweet.

Big thanks to Ozgur for the friendly and attentive service! Will come back againüíï"

Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Very nice upscale restaurant in Oxford Circus. My family was seeking Italian food while on holiday in London and we found this place via Google reviews. We were not disappointed. The setting was great, the server was nice and patient and the food was amazing. The portion sizes are a little small considering the price. This was the only restaurant we visited that hit us with a VAT tax charge as well as a 12.5% service charge. The restaurant was packed and it was loud but we could still talk and enjoy our meals."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The most beautiful surprise, we had accidentally come to this restaurant and were not disappointed at all. No comments about the food, go taste it for yourself, it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Also you will be lucky if Fozil is your waiter ( very kind guy ). Much recommended"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Wonderful Italian restaurant in SoHo. We showed up with a family of 5 without a reservation (not recommended!!). The staff was kind and accommodating. They turned the heaters on outside and even offered a lap blanket to my wife. Pasta was delicious and service was excellent. The vanilla ice cream was out of this world! We have spent the last week trying to find it for purchase. Pricey to feed a large family but worth every penny.
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Decided to go here on a whim and it was completely worth it. The restaurant was beautiful, the food was amazing (the best Italian food I‚Äôve ever had) and the staff was warm and welcoming. It was an overall exceptional dining experience. I absolutely recommend checking this place out if you are ever in the area."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a fantastic experience at this Italian restaurant! Went with my husband and little one, super kid friendly.. The pasta was absolutely delicious ‚Äî perfectly cooked and full of flavor. We also tried the tiramisu, and it was one of the best I‚Äôve had; light, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The venue itself is beautiful, with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. A special shoutout to our waiter, Ozzy Ozzy, who was so attentive throughout the evening. He gave us great recommendations from the menu and made sure everything arrived promptly. Great service really made the night. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Overall, amazing vibes and super attentive service but for what it cost, the food doesn‚Äôt quite live up to the hype. Starters like the calamari and burrata salad were fresh and tasted good but nothing to write home about. I had the pappardelle beef ragu - this was comforting and tasted good but compared to my other experiences with this dish, it was alright. The chocolate bomb for dessert was great - I do really recommend this! And the complimentary limoncello shot was a nice touch."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Arrived at 6:00 on a Friday and they were busy, but luckily the host was very helpful and they were able to provide a table for 5 with no wait.
Our server Ozgur was outstanding, very attentive, with good recommendations on meals, and care to ensure everything was to our liking.
Highly recommended, but next time I will get a reservation."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We had beef carpaccio and calamari for starters, both of them were wonderful. We also ordered carbonara and porcini risotto, the carbonara was delicious and the tiramisu was great too. The service from Fozil was amazing, he was so nice and gave recommendations to us. It was a fantastic experience."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Came for dinner and the place was buzzing with activity. Despite how busy it was, the staff were incredibly helpful and efficient. Every dish we tried was delicious, but I especially recommend the prawns with artichoke and asparagus, as well as the pappardelle with beef ragu, both were outstanding. Make sure to book your table in advance, as it gets quite busy!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The staff is polite and attentive, Ozzy and his colleagues did their utmost to provide us with a wonderful eating experience.
The food was absolutely delicious - every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.
We will be back for sure!!
Faros is definitely a new favorite spot!"

My husband and I had lunch at Faros Oxford Circus, and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî fresh, flavorful, and clearly made with care. The staff were also incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back, and highly recommend Faros to anyone looking for great Italian food in central London."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Excellent! My Caprese was lovely but would have liked one more slice of tomato and basil rather than the leaves provided which were not as full of flavour. However the Fresh Pappardelle Beef Ragu was sensational! Not cheap but well worth it
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Just had lunch. Food was amazing. The service was even better.

Ruby our host was incredible, we were celebrating our friend‚Äôs birthday and she was fantastic."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"absolutely loved my dinner here! staff were super attentive and friendly, especially our waiter Jasur, and the food was absolutely delicious!"

A special shoutout to Ozgur, who provided exceptional service throughout our visit. He was friendly, attentive, and made sure everything was perfect from start to finish. His recommendations were spot on, and he went out of his way to make us feel at home.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great food and top-notch service. Will definitely be back soon!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I had their sourdough bread, burrata tagliatelle and tiramisu for dessert. Sourdough bread was not the best but the tagliatelle and the tiramisu were on point. My friends on the table loved their al fungi pasta and pizza. Staff were friendly and accommodative of our requests!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Love the risotto. It tastes so delicious. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Italian cuisine
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had a wonderful dinner experience at Faros last week, that made us come back for  a second dinner three days later. The team at Farros were able to accomedate us and provide us with a table within five minutes of arrival without a prior booking. Even though the restaurant was relatively full. We were served by Ozzy who took very good care of us."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I've lost count of my visits, but every time feels like the first time I fell in love with this place. Personally, the star of their menu is undoubtedly the Calamari and the Truffle Pasta! Big thanks to our waiter Eggy, who was tremendously helpful and attentive."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Lively atmosphere, open kitchen and nice small menu. The food, although on the price-y side of things, was good and worth it. But the best thing was undoubtedly the service. Everybody was really friendly and attentive."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's a nice restaurant in central London! My friend and I made a reservation on Friday and had luck getting a table. The service was very friendly and attentive, we loved our server Asha! and the pasta was delicious. I got the burrata pasta, and it was lovely, and my friend liked her ragu a lot.

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Last week, during our visit to London, we had the opportunity to experience this highly talked-about restaurant, which we had also come across on social media. As Manchester residents who frequently travel to London, discovering new culinary gems is always exciting for us. From the moment we stepped in, we were impressed by the restaurant‚Äôs beautifully designed and welcoming atmosphere.

I would particularly like to highlight the service‚Äî√ñzg√ºr looked after us exceptionally well, making our experience feel even more special. The presentation of the dishes was modern and creative, yet the authenticity of traditional flavours remained intact. Every dish was a perfect blend of high-quality ingredients and expert craftsmanship, showcasing a true passion for gastronomy.

Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I had a great experience here! Mehmet was incredibly friendly and made us feel so welcome from the whole time through .

The service was outstanding and made the whole evening even more memorable. Highly recommend this place, and thank you again to Ozgur for the wonderful service!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"It's a good experience and the service is very good. Shrimp and squid rings are especially recommended for food, which are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The location is also good. It is very close to the subway station and worth visiting, and Ailcan gave us a free lemon wine."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The restaurant experience was great! Mehmet was very patient and the food was excellent, especially the black truffle risotto. Mehmet finished the meal by handing us two glasses of Limoncello. Thank you very much for his service."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Mushroom pasta - absolutely mouth watering. Crisp bread and butter to start with. Two different by the glass wines tasted - malbec and chianti - both good. Plus efficient service and a nice table outside - overall a very good experience!
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Very authentic flavour and menu. Pleased to see affogato was on the menu and there were a variety of options for those who do not eat meat. The hostess was very attentive and she did a great job supporting Ruby and the other members of staff. Very easy to locate from Oxford Circus tube station.
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Had the most incredible dinner here! The food was absolutely amazing‚Äîevery dish was full of flavor and beautifully presented.

We were served by Mehmet who was really attentive and made us feel comfortable and welcome."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Dined here Friday night for my wife‚Äôs 30th birthday celebrations. The food was out of this world and all the staff there were incredibly friendly and attentive, especially Yeliz who was just fantastic. Food is very fairly priced for the quality you are getting. Will definitely be back next time we are in London"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"We wanted to hate this place. The reviews can‚Äôt be true. Impossible for central London to be 4.9** but honestly.

Starter perfect, pesto great. Burrata fresh and not straight out the fridge.

Truffle pasta creamy and rich. Ragu plentiful and delicious. The desserts were also just lovely and light and the coffee was amazing.

Service also top notch and a song for my partners birthday was such a nice touch!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The food here is always amazing! I come here all the time and usually order the pasta and prawns. I‚Äôm quite picky with flavours, so it‚Äôs hard for me to find pasta and prawns that I really enjoy, but every time I get them here they‚Äôre made perfectly for me. Ozzy  is always very respectful and welcoming he makes my time here feel warm and enjoyable."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"This place deserves 5 stars! Delicious food and outstanding service

We were impressed by OZGUR professionalism and warm demeanor.
They truly enhanced our dining experience"
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"Went on a Friday evening for an early dinner. We had a great time. The place itself has great decor, with open kitchen and bar. We shared all the dishes- Burrata salad, garlic bread, pizza and two pastas.

The menu offers great variety for vegetarians. There are plenty of dishes to choose from and could add extra ingredients to dishes if it was possible.

We were served by Ozgur. He was attentive and helpful."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Great traditional Italian restaurant at the heart of London!

Nice service too and highly recommend."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"My partner and I had a great experience at Faros this evening. Top class service from all staff, but especially Asma who was incredibly attentive and made our experience that little bit more special. The Tiramisu in particular was outstanding."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"My girlfriend and I had such an incredible experience here tonight. From the moment we walked in, finding a table was smooth and welcoming, and the entire staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.

The biggest shout out goes to our server, Ruby. She‚Äôs an absolute rockstar‚Äîone of those rare people who truly elevates the entire experience. Attentive, kind, and full of great energy, she made the night feel like so much more than just dinner.

The food was fantastic, but it was Ruby and the team who turned it into a night we‚Äôll remember. We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I had an amazing experience at Faros and a big part of that was thanks to the waiter, Jarus From the moment I sat down, he was warm, welcoming, and incredibly attentive without being overbearing. His positive energy genuinely made the meal feel special.

It's rare to come across someone who clearly takes pride in their service and genuinely cares about the customer‚Äôs experience. Jasur went above and beyond ‚Äî and because of him, I‚Äôll definitely be coming back.

Highly recommend asking for him if you visit!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"The food was simply delicious, each dish bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. Ozzy‚Äôs friendly and attentive service made the evening truly special ‚Äî he was quick to anticipate our needs and added a personal touch that made us feel at home. Highly recommended!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Faros, and I must say, it was an experience that truly stood out. From the moment I walked in, the classy yet homely atmosphere created an inviting and comfortable environment. The d√©cor strikes a perfect balance between elegance and warmth, making it ideal for both special occasions and a refined, casual meal.

To start, I ordered the minestrone soup, which was absolutely delicious. The broth was rich and well-seasoned, with a generous variety of fresh vegetables that gave it both texture and depth of flavor. The soup was served with bread, though I did find myself wishing for a bit of butter to accompany it ‚Äì a small touch that would have made the starter perfect.

For the main course, I opted for the fresh pappardelle beef ragu, and I can confidently say it was one of the best pasta dishes I‚Äôve ever had. The pappardelle itself was cooked to perfection ‚Äì tender with just the right amount of bite ‚Äì while the beef ragu was bursting with flavor. The sauce was rich, hearty, and clearly made with high-quality ingredients, creating a dish that was both comforting and indulgent.

Given the quality of the food and the overall high-end feel of the restaurant, the prices were on the higher side, but that‚Äôs to be expected for a place of this caliber. Honestly, considering the taste and presentation, I felt the meal was well worth the cost.

Service was another highlight of the evening. The staff were exceptionally friendly, attentive without being overbearing, and the food arrived impressively quickly. It‚Äôs clear that Faros prides itself not just on its menu but on delivering a complete dining experience.

Overall, my visit to Faros was outstanding. The combination of delicious food, quick and friendly service, and a classy yet cozy ambiance makes it a place I‚Äôd highly recommend. If you‚Äôre looking to treat yourself to an unforgettable meal, this is definitely the spot to visit."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Delicious food and exceptional service‚ÄîJass was friendly, attentive, and made us feel truly welcome."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,We had a great dinner and a great service by Miss Ruby today August 13 and the service was great. The food was tasty. We had risotto with seafood as well as Margherita pizza and also calamari and Melanie‚Äôs chicken. But what makes our food is good is the service and miss Ruby that she was very Smiling and taking care of us all the time. We will come back again and have dinner here again.
Faros Oxford Circus,1.0,"Food was average and served in small portion‚Äîover priced as suggested by other comments. The service was adequate and commercial, but certainly not charming or personable. Atmosphere was mediocre. Unfortunately, superficial comes to mind to describe Faros."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Good food and excellent service! Our server Eggy was very attentive and made the whole experience even better.
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Highly Recommend!

Me and my friend were waited by Maryam this evening, A lovely waitress, and outstanding service. Food was beautiful, as were drinks. We Will definitely re-visit again!"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,The food is amazing. Recommend the Fresh truffle pasta. Jass gave us great service!
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Yummy food, superb ambience, and great service from Ozgur.
I had the best Carbonara ever.
I will be back."
Faros Oxford Circus,4.0,"It‚Äôs a great place to get some nice food and get a break from a busy Oxford Street while still staying central.
The atmosphere is really nice and the staff is very attentive and always happy to help without being too much which I did appreciate.
We went on a Friday evening and booked a table on the same day, but considering it‚Äôs a busy place and all the tables were full, I would recommend booking at least few days in advance.
Me and my friend got margarita pizza and truffle pasta which we both think were great. Portions size was also decent for the price.
I would recommend, it is a very pretty place with a chill atmosphere."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Never been here in 40 yrs of coming to London but so pleased we found it. The food was fantastic and despite bring a hot day it was lovely and cool inside. Service was first class and we were asked if everything was OK at appropriate times, without being pushy.
All in all a fantastic place to dine and will definitely return. Thankyou for a lovely meal."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"This place was such a pleasant surprise, as I hadn‚Äôt heard much about it and had chosen it randomly. The food, service and atmosphere were just fantastic, feels rare to get all 3 these days. Can‚Äôt wait to eat here again, I had a great time."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"As far as food and service goes - it‚Äôs excellent.

As far as portion sizes for the price tag - afraid on the pricier side.

The mains are ¬£27 - ¬£30 and we left hungry. To be honest - we should have seen the menu and prices before committing to a casual Sunday lunch!

This place can be easily ¬£60 per head if you include a starter, main and a drink.

Would I come again? YES! But I need to find an occasion! Not a casual lunch"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Excellent restaurant close to Oxford Street. I have visited here several times and have always had an excellent experience. The food is very good and the restaurant has a great atmosphere and whilst it can get very busy it doesn't get overly noisy.

Service is excellent (and they only added on 5% service to the bill!). A particular shout out to Asma who was exceptional on my last visit (20th November), nothing was too much trouble and she made a real fuss of one of guests who was 93 which was really appreciated.

I would definitely recommend a visit here and will be returning again soon"
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,We had a fantastic dinner in Faro. Our waiter Ruby was so helpful in her recommendations and had a very warm and welcoming presence. She was so kind and helpful with any requests we had. The food and drink was excellent. Will definitely be returning.
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,"Faros is a gem - a real find.

We were celebrating my birthday with a visit to the Palladium, so we did some research into good restaurants nearby for a pre-theatre supper and immediately noted how highly rated Faros was across the board.  We therefore booked, never having visited before and hoping for the best.

We need not have worried as we had an absolutely outstanding evening in every way: starting with stunningly devised signature cocktails, our party of four went on to enjoy a range of quite superb dishes, perfectly prepared and presented with great care and skill, subtle yet full of flavour and colour, complemented by an excellent wine list, and all supported by what felt to us like exemplary service that was both attentive without fuss and constantly smiling and friendly.  The whole thing reached a climax when my ice cream arrived with a birthday candle in it and three of the team serenaded us with 'Happy Birthday'.  As others have remarked, the warm atmosphere created by the staff really is a feature.

The restaurant is also delightfully situated on a corner of Gt Portland Street and Margaret St, with surrounding windows as a feature that make for an interior ambience ideally balanced between light airiness and cosy intimacy.

We were amazed not to have visited before, and look forward to returning - perhaps next time making the meal rather than the theatre the centre of the evening.

We will remember it as the perfect celebration we had hoped for, memorable for all the right reasons and exceptionally happy.  I only wish we had taken some pictures to illustrate this review.

We could not have asked for more, or better, in every way - and nor was it excessively expensive.

We can highly recommend Faros without hesitation.  Truly first class."
Faros Oxford Circus,5.0,Had a really good dinner with my mom. Linguine Allo Scoglio tastes so good! Big thanks to Fozil for his really good service!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,,Óóä
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Bill‚Äôs Soho Restaurant is a fantastic place that I highly recommend in the heart of London. I visited for a late breakfast (brunch), and it was an excellent experience from start to finish. The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented ‚Äì I tried the eggs with sides, and everything tasted perfect. The restaurant has a cozy, stylish atmosphere with a mix of modern and classic d√©cor, making it a great spot for friends or family. The staff were friendly, attentive, and provided quick service with a smile, which made the visit even more enjoyable. A must-try in Soho!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"Food was very good. Recommend the porridge and the eggs Benedict. The ham they used is great. As an essentially vegetarian person i made an exception for it.
Service was good not exceptional bit no complaints.
Love the atmosphere. Always visit when in London."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Delicious eggs, avocado and mushrooms.
Welcoming atmosphere with great relaxing music.
The place to be for a healthy breakfast in the core of London.
So accommodating to our dietary needs too üòâ
And good news: prices are fair and you won‚Äôt be ripped off ü§©"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"Bill‚Äôs food is always great and I do enjoy sitting their restaurants. However, perhaps it was the weekend and it was in soho, the tables were crowded together. I found it difficult to squeeze into my seat as there is no space between my chair and the table. The waiter had to hand everything to us from behind as there was no way he could walk to our table."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"This place is amazing!
Lovely decor and amazing food (I already want to go again!). Staff was really nice
I recommend booking just in case"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,My husband and I had a great experience at Bills. Our waitress Dora was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was incredibly helpful when it came to helping me with my allergies. They have an entire gluten free menu which was incredible and made me feel very safe eating there. I got the vegan and gluten free pancakes and they were delicious. My husband who does not have any allergies got the eggs royal and he said they were very good as well. This was a great place to eat if you have allergies or not!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I had a fantastic experience at Bill‚Äôs in Westfield Shepherd‚Äôs Bush. From the moment we arrived, the service was outstanding. We were looked after by Clem, who was attentive, friendly, and made us feel really welcome  truly amazing service.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a relaxed meal. I ordered the chargrilled 8oz sirloin steak with rosemary fries, which was cooked to perfection  juicy, flavorful, and beautifully presented. My partner had a burger, and it was just as impressive: delicious, perfectly seasoned, and generously portioned.

The food was exemplary, the service top-notch, and the overall experience left us both very happy. I‚Äôd highly recommend Bill‚Äôs Shepherd‚Äôs Bush to anyone looking for great food and excellent hospitality. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"Evening meal party of four, with two starters and four mains. Service was good, but only one server for a number of tables led to delays at certain times. The food was good, but needed better spice balance. We enjoyed the prawn starter, very nicely done, followed by a burger, Caesar salad, fish pie, and shawarma. These were also well prepared. Oddly enough, the shawarma came at least 5 minutes prior to the other mains. In addition, we had to wait a while for a cocktail to be re-made (15 minutes).

We enjoyed the atmosphere and think this might‚Äôve been just an off night for our table"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I had an incredible experience with a truly remarkable team! Their outstanding service made every moment unforgettable. I want to give a special shout-out to the manager, Kat, whose energy and dedication were nothing short of inspiring. If you're looking for the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion, I wholeheartedly recommend this venue. They'll make your party an event to remember!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Staff are really friendly and attentive, and the restaurant is very clean, with a nice atmosphere. Dora was our server and was super attentive and helpful. We ordered a big brunch plate, the biscoff pancakes, and the maple bacon pancakes. All were super filling, nicely presented, and delicious. Biscoff pancakes could use a bit more syrup, but the vanilla cream was delicious. Coffee was okay, nothing out if this world, though there is a big attention to detail in terms of types of milk used and teas."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,We passed by and decided to eat here. Great experience. Our waitress Katherine is great and service customer is definitely her thing. There are plenty of options in the menu. I Highly recommend.
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Loved our meal here! Great food, great service! Friendly fun atmosphere. Gorgeous welcome from staff from walking in, table service from Mo. Good choice of vegan and vegetarian alongside meat dishes for non-veggie friends."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"The service and food was brilliant, one of our party has celiac disease, and it's very rare that we can all find a place we can all enjoy a meal together, this restaurant offers its own menu for gluten free meals and they were amazing, I would definitely recommend this restaurant. well done for making a difference"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Great food! Beautiful interior, nice staff.

Our server was Yolanda! Very nice and gave us fast and good service, plus a little chat at the end about our time in england! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I had a great time at Bill‚Äôs earlier this Saturday evening. Been to other branches before, but this one is beyond my favourite. Massive thank you to the team: Francesco, Paolo, Martina and Yolanda for making my day. I recommend the strawberry margarita, will definitely be back."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,We had our first breakfast in London at Bill's cause it was right next to our hotel and both the food and the service were excellent. Particularly our waitress Kushi who was extraordinary kind and patient with our girl's eternal doubts deciding which pancakes she wanted. Thanks a lot!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I recently visited Bill's Restaurant and had an absolutely fantastic experience! From the moment I walked in, the hospitality was exceptional. The staff was warm, welcoming, and genuinely attentive, making sure every aspect of my dining experience was flawless.

As someone who needs to follow a gluten-free diet, I was especially impressed by how considerate and knowledgeable the team was about their gluten-free menu options. They took the time to go over everything with me, ensuring that all my needs were met without any hassle.

The highlight of the meal was the vegan food platter‚Äîit was, without a doubt, the best I've had so far! Each dish was thoughtfully prepared, bursting with fresh flavors, and beautifully presented. It was a true celebration of plant-based cuisine, and I left feeling completely satisfied and energized.

To top it all off, I received a generous discount, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. Great food, top-tier service, and a welcoming atmosphere‚ÄîI'll definitely be back and highly recommend Bill's Restaurant to anyone looking for a memorable meal!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"We were hungry, and this place hit the spot. Although it was reasonably busy, the service was fast and friendly, and the food came in good time.
Everything was lovely, and being modern, we paid the bill using the QR code on the table, so no waiting for bills, etc"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Very quick service, all of the waiters were very kind and helpful. Food was amazing. Large choice of drinks. We will definitely return in the future"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic food, exceptional gluten-free options‚Äî-in fact, there was an entirely separate menu for those with gluten allergies. The eggs Benedict dish (not gluten free) was amazing, but our server, Rose, was even better. Delightful, attentive, and friendly. Give Rose a raise. If you can. Rose deserves it."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,Friendly staff and fun unusual decor. Nice menu with wide range of options. Burger was great
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Dora was great!! Very helpful with the menu and making sure I was good with everything between my meals! Everything was flavor but the cinnamon donuts was amazing!!!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Lovely evening at Bills in Soho. Amazing armosphere, delicious food and exceptional service from our waiter, Mo. Thanks for a special birthday meal."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Absolutely! Here's that review from your perspective:
Wow, Bill's Soho in London became my absolute favorite place to eat in the entire city. It was the perfect spot to dine with my family, and honestly, the best of all the places we tried. The attention we received was just amazing ‚Äì everyone was so kind and attentive, making us feel truly welcome. And the food? Oh my goodness, it was absolutely delicious! Every single dish was a delight, and I'm still thinking about how incredible it all tasted. If I ever have the chance to visit London again, you can bet the first place I'll be heading is straight back to Bill's Soho for another bite of their incredible food. It's an experience I won't soon forget!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"A lovely restaurant In a great location. A real good menu with enough choice to satisfy the pickiest of eaters. I was in the mood for a delicious burger, and it did not disappoint. A nice range of cocktails, and juices too that will be guaranteed to put a smile on your face. I recommend you give this a try on your next adventure out."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"We had a pre-theatre dinner and the food was great, it just took a bit longer to arrive than expected, but Saeed noticed without us needing to 'complain' about it and he made our dining experience at Bill's Soho absolutely wonderful!!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Service was so fast and all staff were attentive . Kushi our server made us feel welcome and was very helpful ! 10/10 reccomend !
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"It's a nice place with good service and food. They don't rush you or try to push the daily specials into you.
I had Eggs Benedict with a side of fried potatoes and an Eton Colada Sundae both of which were very nice.
Overall, reasonable value for the money."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Currently I work at bill's victoria so I'm quite familiar with the food I'm going to be ordering, I just wanted to try the chefs special dishes, was sat down by a great waiter who name I didn't get unfortunately, I'll describe him as very chill but understanding and respectful, white guy with a full beard, hair tied up and I think he had tattoos, yeah him, he was great. Food was as good as it looked, and it looked great. Not much else to say other than it was a great visit, would definitely recommend coming here, with friends, especially on Fridays during 3-5 pm üòâüòÅüëçüèæ"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,1.0,"Worst service from the staff. I sat by myself, unfortunately, thinking I could as no one was around to sit me and there were no signs stating to wait to be seated. Anyways, I‚Äôm not sure if that got one of the server, a lady who wasn‚Äôt wearing a uniform like the rest, to be unfriendly towards me. I ordered and not a word of hi, thanks etc while she was going around greeting and being nice to other diners, which to me seems deliberate and immature if her intentions was to spike me.

And when it came to serving, not a smile, thank you and she served my food and drink over the seat instead of standing next to me like most decent restaurant/diners would.

Please avoid at all cost, and to protect your sanity and wallet if you‚Äôre a foreigner. They won‚Äôt treat you kindly. And in case you‚Äôre wondering, I was smiling the whole time, and was nice to her like a normal human being would do. And she‚Äôs in a service line, no reason to be rude at all. If I could give a zero, I would. Again, stay away from this diner. We are all paying customers, be nice and courteous. And be a human"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Dora was our amazing server today. She was very attentive, friendly and went above and beyond to make our meal a greay experience. The meal was not rushed, the food was very tasty and she remembered drinks orders and allergies on second orders without being reminded and continued to bring tap water without being asked. Highly recommend and she made the meal and evening a lovely experience."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"We visited Bill's after our Theatre trip and it was really nice. The food was delicious and the service fantastic. All of the staff I encountered were friendly, welcoming,  efficient and professional.

Our server, Yolanda, was brilliant aswell - nothing was too much trouble.

Thank you for a lovely evening :-)"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"Food was ok, ambiance wasn't bad, located in a central area and not too pricey too.
Best part was meeting family over the food ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"I recently had breakfast at Bill's, and overall, it was a pleasant experience. The food was tasty and nicely presented, with a traditional English feel to the ambiance which added a lovely touch to the meal. However, the dishes were served somewhat lukewarm, and I felt they could have benefited from a bit more seasoning. Despite that, it was still an enjoyable experience, and I'd consider going back for the cozy atmosphere."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"We had dinner here and Yolanda provided great service. She was professional, attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and gave us great recommendations. The chips were tasty, didn‚Äôt love the duck. Finally love how Yolanda is bilingual."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Welcoming atmosphere with great relaxing music.

The place to be for a healthy breakfast in the core of London.

Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"We visited for breakfast on a sunny morning in London. The big windows were all open and it was a very pleasant atmosphere.

Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Bill‚Äôs Soho Restaurant delivered an outstanding dining experience from start to finish! The warm welcome and attentive service (shout-out to Katherine, our lovely waitress!) set the tone for a memorable meal. As someone who values gluten-free options, I was thrilled to see a dedicated menu‚Äîrarely do restaurants cater so thoughtfully to dietary needs.

Bill's Soho Restaurant,1.0,"‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

I was recently contacted by someone offering me $5 to leave a fake 5-star review for Bill‚Äôs Soho. I refused, but it‚Äôs concerning that this is happening.

Please be cautious when reading reviews here ‚Äì not all of them may be genuine. I wanted to share this so people know the reality and can make informed decisions."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Dined at Bill's in Soho recently and had a wonderful time! The food was delicious, with the duck curry being a standout.

Our waitress, Patricia, was absolutely fantastic. She was so helpful, friendly, and genuinely kind. Patricia offered excellent menu recommendations, was incredibly attentive without being intrusive, and made our dining experience truly enjoyable.

We'll definitely be back soon."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Bill's Soho

Located in the heart of Soho, Bill's offers a lively atmosphere perfect for any meal.

We began with the signature Nachos, loaded with cheese and guacamole, bursting with flavor. For the main course, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Burger was exceptional‚Äîcrispy and tender, served with sweet potato fries that were perfectly seasoned.

We topped off our meal with a warm Chocolate Fondant, rich and gooey, paired beautifully with vanilla ice cream.

The staff was friendly and attentive, making our experience enjoyable. Bill's Soho is a must-visit for delicious food and a fun vibe!"

Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I love the Bill's Restaurants very much. Whenever I'm in London a Stop for a Breakfast at Bill's is a must. I've been at the Soho Bill's for the Second time.

Overall, it was a lovely spot for a casual brunch. I‚Äôd definitely go back!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,3.0,"Overview: Chain restaurant with a large range of dish offerings.

Pros‚úÖ: The decor of the restaurant is nice, homely and gives good ambience. Large choice of dishes on the menu to choose from. The waiters that served us were friendly and accommodating

Cons‚ùå: The food was disappointing. The flavour of the korean cauliflower was good but the cauliflower was undercooked. The aubergine parmigiana had really bad parmesan that tasted off and the aubergine skin was burnt and bitter. Their card machine also does not accept Revolut."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Thank you very much Esra for the friendly service you provided. We had a great breakfast experience.
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I have allergies and intolerances and the menu has so many options! I got the brunch plate which was really nice. My server Dora was super helpful, kind and went the extra mile."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"we walked by this place several times it wasn‚Äôt real busy and I thought I wanted to try it so we went back but when we went back, it was gay pride weekend. The food was unique and delicious. The service was great considering they were packed and the other reason I gave them a four with atmosphere is because it was crowded. We got still a lovely table sitting on the open window and I love watching the crowds going by."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"This was the best food we have had in a long time since moving here, will definitely be back service was amazing & food was fresh !"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Food was great! Fun and lively atmosphere. Dan is the MAN! Took care of us for my parents 33rd wedding anniversary and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience! Until next time!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Great atmosphere here, nicely busy but plenty of space around where we were seated, so not cramped, we ate from the lunchtime specials, 3 courses for ¬£21.50.  Excellent value for money, proper full sized portions which we weren‚Äôt expecting. Super tasty food and excellent coffee too, and a novelty for London to find the toilets are on the ground floor.
Glad we came in here pre theatre, perfect restaurant today, thank you"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Fantastic experience! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere warm and inviting. Francesco provided outstanding service ‚Äî friendly, attentive, and professional.

Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Bill‚Äôs Soho offers a cozy, relaxed atmosphere in the heart of London, perfect for a casual brunch, lunch, or dinner. The menu features a mix of modern British comfort food with a few global twists ‚Äî think hearty burgers, fresh salads, and seasonal specials. Standouts include the buttermilk chicken burger and the indulgent triple chocolate brownie. Service is generally friendly and efficient, though it can get busy during peak hours. A reliable spot for good food, decent prices, and a warm, inviting vibe."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Fantastic service by Dani! The sticky toffee pudding is so good! The salad sizes are generous.
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Loved it for dinner, CRISPY STICKY DUCK, DUCK CURRY and STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. Followed next morning for breakfast EGGS BENEDICT."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I had some of the bottomless pancakes today at Bills and had a very enjoyable experience, they were quite busy but Mo attended to me as quickly as he could and made my experience a good one. I would definitely come back again with friends"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,3.0,"Lovely atmosphere and the staff were great although incredibly busy.

I ordered the spiced tortilla (which I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be tortilla chips) and I did enjoy it.

I also got the Caesar salad which was really really disappointing. The dressing was watery and flavourless. Although the salad was presented nicely and the chicken was cooked really well the dressing just made everything soggy and pooled at the bottom like soup.
I was expecting the elderflower lemonade to be more exciting as well considering it was ¬£4.50 but it was just soda water and a syrup rather than something prebottled (which is what you would expect for the price).

I had an okay experience."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Great brunch spot! I ordered the scrambled eggs and pancakes, and both were absolutely delicious. The eggs were fluffy and well-seasoned, and the pancakes were soft and perfectly sweet. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a tasty and satisfying brunch."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"This is the third year in a row that we‚Äôre spending our December holiday in London. The breakfast at Bill‚Äôs has left a lasting impression on us, along with the always friendly and relaxed service attitude.

Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"I recently visited Bill's Restaurant at saturday and had a fantastic experience!the hospitality and staff was warm.

The restaurant is hot and they have to use cooler inside."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Lovely brunch at Bill's. Second visit and both times friendly and attentive staff. Food was really good quality and nice and hot.
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Popped into Soho and we couldn‚Äôt have had a better waitress!
Roshanna, was so attentive and chatty!
And the brunch martini was lovely!!
Thank you!!"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"First time here prior to a show at the Apollo.

No wait time, nice food and drink selection, courteous and helpful staff, enjoyed our meal and drink enormously!

Will return asap"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,4.0,"The food wasn't that good to be honest, but not bad either. We had English breakfast and Eggs Benedicte. Both had a very plain taste unfortunately. They totally forgot to salt and season the food. After that we had the famous pancake stack.
The pancakes itself was plain, almost dry, but the topping was incredibly good. We would have liked more toppings since it wasn't enough to cover up for the dry pancakes. The coffee wasn't anything to write home about either.

Friendly staff and they were quick to help with anything you might need.

The atmosphere inside this restaurant is incredible! So cool, so cozy and relaxing. Vibrant but still not loud."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Never had such a haloumi burger neither fish pie. You guys have mastered the cooking. Though it was busy but they have managed ambient atmosphere. Staff and serving was awesome.
Bill's Soho Restaurant,3.0,"What a cool place with funky decor and music. Service was pretty prompt given how busy it was. The menu is really extensive catering to all appetites. My burgers was divine but the eggs weren‚Äôt a favourite of the other guests. Relatively pricey however given the location, it‚Äôs to be expected. ‚ÄúKids eat free‚Äù available although unsure of the details so check this out."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,The food was lovely and it exceeded my expectations. Will come back again. Food service was quick and it was very clean. Highly recommended!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"My friend and I are visiting from the states and stopped in for dinner. Yolanda was an amazing server making sure we got everything we needed for our meal. The food is impeccable, the vibe of the restaurant is unmatched in a fun, upbeat, happy to be here kind of way.
We had the calamari, cauliflower, classic burger, sweet potato fries, and the mini salted caramel dessert. Zero notes, everything was beyond delicious and definitely will be back for their daily bottomless pancakes :)"
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,"Lovely staff  - thanks Ahmedüòä and decent breakfast, with a brekkie bundle you get good price. Recommended."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,5.0,Good food and good vibes. Our server Mo provided a great service!
Bill's Soho Restaurant,1.0,"First time. We reserved a dinner at Bills. But we went earlier in the day to see if it was nice. No waiting. We ordered sausage rolls and drinks.
The drinks were good but they brought us hamburger buns with slices of old dry sausages inside. When we inquired they said ""that's our sausage rolls !"". We paid for everything and left. Oh and cancelled our dinner reservations."
Bill's Soho Restaurant,3.0,"I had a booking for 12:15, arrived on time and had  to join a long queue. what is the point of booking a specific time when you cannot guarantee us a table ?? Me and my friend were seated only around 12:30, mind you we arrived earlier and were starving. please consider to organise a vacant space for a customer from the time they have booked a table ! it was very uncomfortable for us to wait on a hungry stomach, especially that we had to leave in less than 2h because we made other plans, therefore our experience was cut short at Bill‚Äôs simply because the table has not been organized from our initial booking time."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,,Óóä
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,4.0,"Beautiful atmosphere and delicious Indian food. I got the butter chicken, but don‚Äôt let the mild spice level fool you, it is spicy, but the perfect amount for someone who enjoys spice but doesn‚Äôt want to die from the heat. It was my first time trying orange wine, for those curious, it tastes just like a glass of white with an orange tint in color. Would return for solid Indian food and it is the perfect spot to grab a bite before enjoying a show at the Lyceum Theatre"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"We had the best pre-theatre meal here.
The service was fast, efficient and friendly and our server Sam couldn‚Äôt have done more for us.
The only downside was that we accidentally ordered a more expensive wine than we intended to‚Ä¶ it was lovely though.
Thank you so much!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"I had a great lunch experience at Paro in London. The food was fantastic ‚Äì truly one of the best chicken curries I‚Äôve ever had. Full of flavour, perfectly cooked, and beautifully presented.

Our waiter, Sam, was excellent ‚Äì friendly, attentive, and made us feel very welcome. Although my tea was initially forgotten with the order, the staff fixed it immediately when I mentioned it, which I really appreciated. Mistakes can happen, but how they‚Äôre handled makes all the difference ‚Äì and the team handled it perfectly.

Overall, excellent service and very nice staff. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back.

Best regards,
Tobi"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Delicious food and top-quality meat.  Everything was full of flavor and freshly prepared. The service was excellent. Special thanks to Fuhad and his team for being so friendly, attentive, and professional. We felt truly welcome. Highly recommended!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"What a surprisingly great tasting and highly authentic Indian restaurant tucked away behind Covent Garden. Everything from the FOH, waiting staff, ambience, and of course the food, was impeccable.

I highly recommend any of the generous prawn dishes, starter or main, and the onion bhaji's are so well cooked, really crisp but full of body and flavour, and the complex flavouring of the spices in each dish is elegant but punchy. Just what you want in a proper Indian restaurant.

We'll almost certainly be returning, and not even alongside a theatre night, as Paro stands alone as the best Indian in this part of Central London."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,3.0,"The ambiance is cute, food was okay. I felt like it lacked some depth. The samosa was okay and the korma was very sweet. Service could have been better. We had 7:00 reservations and felt rushed when it wasn‚Äôt even busy. They wanted to quickly clear the table and then told us there is a reservation and we had to leave. It was 8:10 at that point. We weren‚Äôt even there that long and was rushed out. Even when the check was brought over things were very rushed. Dessert wasn‚Äôt offered or anything else for that matter. It wasn‚Äôt terrible but wont be rushing back any time soon."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,Had a lovely dinner at Paro last night and taken well care of by Sam. Lovely 2 or 3 course pre theatre dinner was delicious and had massive portion sizes. Nice list of speciality drinks too. Very attentive waitstaff.
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Fuhad served as and the service was excellent!
Very attentive and fast!
Came with my daughters, and he made them feel so welcome.
Food was delicious, tasty flavours. Just would have liked the chicken to be softer and for it to flake off! It was quite tough across both chicken dishes.
Restaurant deco was so nice, good vibes"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,Such lovely atmosphere and staff! Adil served us and was very helpful with picking dishes and friendly throughout! They have a special on at the moment where you can get over 40% off when you get the signature Thali! Very generous portion size in veg or non veg! Highly recommend coming here when you are in town for a nice night out!
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"A very cute cozy place.. food was delicious and staff were super friendly. Sam was attentive and took care of my needs sharp. If you are around for shows or shopping, definitely recommend this spot for lunch or dinner. You won‚Äôt regret."

Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"The food was excellent, and the service by Fuhad was outstanding. I loved the restaurant‚Äôs ambiance, with its great selection of music and stylish furniture. The thalis were delicious and generously portioned. The mango lassi is one of the best I‚Äôve had, and the Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Kosmo cocktail was also very good. Overall, a must-visit if you‚Äôre in London."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"We just had the most amazing food experience at Paro. I‚Äôve tried quite a few Indian restaurants in London and I wasn‚Äôt quite convinced but my husband wanted Indian food for his birthday and I found this amazing restaurant as one of the top suggestions. Paro completely changed my view on Indian food, the Cream Chicken Korma is to die for, nothing like I have ever tasted before, all food portions were absolutely worth it, the place is super nicely decorated and Fuhad went up and beyond to give us the most wonderful service, I will be definitely coming back, 100% recommended!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"The food here is well priced for the neighbourhood and very delicious. I asked for a lamb korma which wasn't on the menu, but they made a great dish for me and our service was very good. Sim did an excellent job with the table, thank you to him!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Amazing experience.  Our last evening in London and we wanted a good last dinner. It was easy to reserve a table through their website. We arrive and were greeted and taken immediately to our seat. The restaurant is so clean and the vibe is perfect.

Fuhad our server made our experience even more amazing. He had amazing suggestions. We loved everything!

Thank-you for making our last evening in London enjoyable."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Lovely food and service!

Thanks so much for a great experience."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Joy the head waitor was extremely attentive.

Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,4.0,"Paro is a fantastic Indian restaurant in London with a beautiful, boutique-style ambiance that really sets the mood. We tried both the veg and non-veg thalis, and they were absolutely delicious ‚Äî full of flavor and variety. The portion sizes were very generous, almost too much for us to finish, but definitely great value for money."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Amazing night at a great restaurant! Sam was a great waiter; super attentive and friendly. Service was really good and quick. Food and drinks were delicious. Prices were very reasonable. Went with a few people with food allergies and was pleased that the staff took it seriously. The menu was clear with what food contained gluten, nuts, etc so we felt comfortable what we could order. Will definitely return next time I am in Covent Garden!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,We had such a lovely meal here. The food was amazing and Joy was a great host. All the staff were very welcoming I would definitely recommend this place- great for gluten free as well. It was my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and they gave us free ice cream and card :)
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"We had diner here with 2 families. The food was really tasty. I can recommend the lamb samosa and onion bhaji as a starter. For the main the meat thali is really good.

The cocktails are to die for. Fahad was a great host."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Came to Paro, for a birthday celebration. Joy was our waiter, he was so attentive. Food out was outstanding. Deco was old Kalkata. Meet Naiz Khan the owner, came over to wish my friend  a happy  birthday üéÇ"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Paro had excellent food, the flavours were all really good. We were served quickly and did not feel rushed at all, everyone was very friendly, especially our waiter Joy who was amazing at his job!!! Also the place is very well decorated and very clean. 10/10 thank you joy :))"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,4.0,"We had the Thali through top table offer. The thali came with naan, basmati rice, dhall, raita, pickle, lamb curries, butter chicken. It was really good food, tasted like traditional bengali cooking.
The cocktails a little pricey, a long island iced tea is ¬£26 which seemed overpriced. Musa gave us great service and we were well looked after."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Americans first time visit. We don‚Äôt get Indian food much, but this was outstanding and we‚Äôll be referring to anyone else that visits England. Our server was Fuhad and we so enjoyed speaking with him and he was helpful with our menu choices and provided excellent attentive service!  (Restaurant a bit warm)."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Fuhad !! You are a star !!
This guy treated us like part of his friends, serving and explaining the menu perfectly and .....the food was delicious with generous portions at the point to not finishing all of thr dishes .
Highly recommend!!!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Great food, lovely service. Sam was super helpful with choosing which items to order.

The Thali portions are insane!

Not to mention they serve Kingfisher Beer! ü§åüèΩ

Delicious Mango Lassi as well."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"I had an amazing experience at Paro London, and a huge part of that was thanks to Sam, our server. From the moment we were seated, Sam was warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. He struck the perfect balance between being professional and personable, making us feel looked after without ever being overbearing. His knowledge of the menu was spot on‚Äîhis recommendations were fantastic, and he made sure everything was just right throughout the evening. It‚Äôs rare to come across service that feels this thoughtful and effortless. Thank you, Sam, for making our visit so memorable!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"We recently dinned at Paro on Saturday during I guess their busiest pre-theatre times and here‚Äôs my experience:

Entrance/Service: Greeted by a doorman then  booked in straight away advising how long our table would be (excellent ‚≠êÔ∏è). The decor was gorgeous through out. Love the touch of artificial jasmine flowers hanging from the ceiling.

Food: WOW! Between 3 of us we ordered a mix of lamb, prawn rice and naan. Not too oily, well seasoned and tasty. The taste was balanced through the meals and the portions are big as you have to order main sauce dish then rice or naan to compliment. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Service throughout: there were so many staff. To serve and to help so you was never waiting too long if you had a query or for food ‚≠êÔ∏è

The takeaways: prebook to avoid disappointment. If it‚Äôs pre-theatre booking check the menu and ask for pre-theatre menu as it‚Äôs more cost effective but expect to be very busy. And finally clean toilets. However due to the restaurant sharing the building with Lyceum Theatre, toilets are located underneath the restaurant.

Will definitely recommend and worth re-visiting. ‚≠êÔ∏è"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Paro is a stylish Indian restaurant in the heart of Covent Garden with a vibrant floral-themed interior that creates a unique and Instagram worthy dining atmosphere. The food delivers authentic Indian flavors with a modern twist beautifully presented and satisfying in taste. Service was courteous, although a bit slow during peak hours. While the ambiance is impressive, a bit more attention to table service could elevate the overall experience. Worth visiting if you‚Äôre exploring central London and looking for a flavorful Indian meal in a visually striking setting."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,4.0,"Popped into Paro on a Monday night, thinking it would be quiet, but I was surprised to find it almost full and was lucky to get a table.
Fuhad looked after me and gave me a poppadom on the house with a chutney tray, which was a nice touch.
For my main course, I ordered Chicken Naga and Basmati rice.
The portion when it came was very impressive. There were plenty of chicken pieces.  As for the Naga sauce, it's not the hottest I've had, but the flavour was still there.  I also had a big bottle of Kingfisher lager.
The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is attached to the Lyceum theatre. The toilets are actually shared with the Lyceum."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Our first time visiting Paro before seeing a show this evening and it was fantastic. The food was beautiful, so many succulent flavours, served piping hot and very quickly. The servers couldn‚Äôt do enough for us, especially Musa.

Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,Beautiful restaurant!! Had a great time here with my partner. The service was great from Adil. We were happy and stuffed after eating. Will come back again!
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,1.0,"Location is next to Lyceum Theatre, Atmosphere is good but the food is a MASSIVE LET DOWN. We visited to celebrate our anniversary, booked table for 7pm, left the restaurant by 7:40pm.

At the rate the food was coming out, it was very obvious the food was made before hand and just heated up when ordered. Which contributed to the stale smell and taste and half the dish being cold. Explained below:

We ordered Mixed Poppadums, Panner Tikka (Grill), Bang Bang Chicken, Veg Thali and Meat Thali.

Mixed Poppadums were not fresh, they were flimsy and stale.
Panner Tikka was bland, tasteless and chewy, alongside the stone cold onions which meant they were pre made and just heated up and served. The ""rub"" they coated the paneer with had obvious bright red food colouring and tasted of nothing.

Bang Bang Chicken was basically swimming in Lemon juice, again couldnt taste anything other than lemon.

Meat Thali had Lamb Curry and Butter Chicken. Lamb was tasteless. Butter Chicken was more like Water Chicken, runny and tasteless.

Veg Thali had Paneer Curry and Mix Veg. Paneer was bland, no spice, no taste, just felt like having tomato puree and cold chewy paneer pieces. Mix Veg - I couldnt even swallow it. Tasted and smelt stale and offputting, a mixture of salty, lemon and bitter.

The naans we ordered were Garlic Naans, again no butter on the naans and dry.

The only thing that was edible was the daal and rice. The daal had flavour to it.

The meal costed ¬£100+ between the 2 of us. Will never return!
We drove 2hrs each way into Covent Garden and were at the restaurant for no more than 30/40mins."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"My first visit will not doubt be back again prethetre dinner time

He was very attentive and made sure we were served quickly. The best restaurant experience I‚Äôve had for a long time
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Beautiful and very popular Indian restaurant, recommend booking, we had booked a table but were kept waiting 30 minutes which isn‚Äôt what you expect, however we we‚Äôre in any rush and had a cocktail while waiting, we did have someone keeping us updated about the table so we weren‚Äôt left in the cold!! Staff were friendly and attentive.  We had starters, mains and wine which was about ¬£60 per head, not bad as the food was excellent and we did take home a doggy bag!! Would definitely return."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Absolutely loved this place! The food was full of authentic flavors‚Äîperfectly spiced and incredibly tasty.

Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"We had a really nice time. Joy was very kind and helpful with anything we wanted. The food was tasty, but a bit too fatty."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,4.0,"Nicely decorated restaurant, with very nice service. The food was good, but not spicy at all which was disappointing. The waiter recommended I pick the medium version of the dish I chose, and I should've taken the spicy one, as it was really tasty but couldn't feel any heat. My friends loved their picks though, so I would maybe come back and try something else!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"The food was lush!! Especially their Nani grandma chicken it was amazing, the food came in a good time and was hot and well seasoned. It was a bit too dark in my opinion (in relations to lighting) but that‚Äôs the only critique I have. Our waiter Fuhad was incredible always checking in on us and was a great help!! 10/10 I highly recommend."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"I had an incredible dining experience at this Indian restaurant near Charing Cross! From the moment I walked in, the warm and inviting atmosphere set the tone for a fantastic meal. The food was absolutely outstanding‚Äîrich, flavorful, and authentically spiced, with each dish cooked to perfection.

What truly made the evening exceptional was the impeccable service from Adil. He was attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time. His recommendations were spot-on, and his genuine hospitality made us feel so welcome.

If you‚Äôre looking for amazing Indian food with top-tier service, this place is a must-visit. I‚Äôll definitely be returning soon!"

Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,1.0,"Atmosphere is nice. Staff is friendly but a little bit distracted. Waited around 15-20minutes just to order. Forgot our tap water. But this is nothing. The food itself was tasteless. We tried pretty a lot of stuff, everything except drinks was tasteless‚Ä¶ sorry but I had better indian food on the streets of Malaysia or Thailand, but this was watery ‚Ä¶ we left the food and went to another place to eat. Not the nice place to visit on holidays, maybe ok for casual day eating."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous meal at Paro with incredible service from Fuhad.
Generous with their recommendations and explanations and super fun to banter with as a sole traveller.

I had the Meat Thali and it gave me a taste of all the delights with some added samosa and icecream to totally send me over the edge.

Generous serving sizes and a lovely atmosphere. Recommend particularly if you're crossing off an English Indian curry and West End Show for your bucket list."
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,The food was so delicious! Our server Joy was very attentive and had amazing customer service. Definitely recommend
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,4.0,"I would have loved to give a 5 star for the food but the only thing that let it down was the prawns used for one of the meals where they charge ¬£3 extra but the prawns are small and rubbery.
On a positive note, the restaurant is decorated so nicely and the service was decent. I can‚Äôt recommend enough the lamb pathia - by far the best main meal! And the starters were delicious too!"
Paro - Covent Garden & Strand - Best Indian Restaurant London,5.0,"Amazing service from Sam. Love it. Food really nice and big portions. I was impressed about this place. Small entrance but a really nice restaurant, clean and tide. Fast and good service.
I really recomand it."

The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî full of rich, bold flavors and beautifully presented. I particularly loved the Lamb Rogan and garlic naan, which was some of the best I‚Äôve had in London.

Special shoutout to Sam, our waiter, who made the experience even more memorable. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely attentive without being overbearing. He checked in on us just the right amount.

Whether you‚Äôre craving a classic curry or looking to explore something new, Paro is a must-visit. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"

Happy London,5.0,I highly recommend! The waitresses are super friendly and making sure you have everything you need! The food was fresh and so delicious. There are so many food options to choose from. You even have a button to easily call your waitress to come at any time. I loved the atmosphere as well - very comfy chairs and clean tables. I would return again! This is the best restaurant we've been in London!
Happy London,5.0,"Me and my mom had dinner there tonight.Mind you we found the place ‚Äúby accident‚Äù,by walking past it and our eyes being captured by the pictures and especially the prices.They gave us a table immediately and everyone was very polite.It was out first time here and the servers let us take our time to choose and compare our options.The food was absolutely delicious,almost the same as shown in the pictures.We also attended 2 little shows that made out evening funnier. The desserts were inviting that we were spoiled for choice and it was hard choosing one!"
Happy London,5.0,"I had such a great experience at Happy London! The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äî everything was fresh, flavourful, and served in generous portions. There‚Äôs a great variety on the menu, with plenty of options even for fussy eaters, which is always a big plus.

The desserts were a real highlight ‚Äî truly indulgent and beautifully presented. The staff were all incredibly friendly and attentive, making the whole visit feel warm and welcoming.

On top of all that, the decor and atmosphere were spot on ‚Äî modern, vibrant, and really comfortable. I genuinely can‚Äôt say a bad word about my lunch here. Highly recommend!"
Happy London,3.0,"I had seen a lot of hype on social media about Happy so was expecting the quality of food to be a bit higher. We enjoyed our meal but it was nowhere near as good as people had been saying. The service was good but the food was just ok and because of the price, I‚Äôd choose another less touristy restaurant next time I‚Äôm in London"
Happy London,5.0,"This place is amazing. One of the best services , fast and efficient. The menu is quite rich and includes Asian, Mexican , Italian and British cuisine. I definitely recommend it. There is a good selection of desserts and cocktails."
Happy London,5.0,"Had a great time at Happy London! The food was delicious üòã especially the chicken buns and mozzarella sticks. We tried three kinds of fries and they were all super tasty. The smashed burger was okay, but overall, a very satisfying meal üôèüèº"
Happy London,4.0,"We were impressed by the super fast service and the overall quality of the food. The menu offers a nice variety of dishes that almost everyone can enjoy. We tried the l crispy chicken bun, and  pasta, all of them were delicious! Definitely a place we‚Äôd recommend if you‚Äôre looking for tasty food with quick service."
Happy London,4.0,"The food and desserts were really tasty, and the vibe was super lively ‚Äî there were even a birthday celebration going on that night! Overall, we had a great time. The only downside was that it was a bit hard to get the attention of the staff sometimes ‚Äî we had to wait quite a few times when trying to call someone over, probably because it was a busy evening. Also, the service charge was 20%, which felt a little steep. But honestly, the food so was good that I‚Äôd still recommend this place"
Happy London,5.0,"Great visit here yesterday. Service was great, food came out quick and was delicious.  Lovely atmosphere and we all had a lovely time. Reasonably priced for the center of London."
Happy London,4.0,"Had lunch at Happy London and tried the crispy chicken Caesar salad and the steak with sweet potato fries. The salad was fresh, tasty, and well put together. The steak, however, was just okay, the default cook is medium, and I prefer medium rare, which affected the overall flavour and texture. Sweet potato fries were nice, but the steak didn‚Äôt stand out."
Happy London,5.0,"I had a fantastic experience at Happy London!! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was so cheerful and welcoming. It's no surprise they won an award for being one of the best restaurants in England! A special shoutout to Alexander, who served our dishes with a smile and was incredibly friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend this place for a happy meal!"""
Happy London,5.0,It‚Äôs our first time trying Happy and it is really a great place to dine. Love the ambiance and staff are attentive and friendly. I enjoyed my steak and pasta. Will definitely come back soon ü•∞
Happy London,5.0,"Great food at really good prices for London and definitely the best service. Visited twice within 4-5 days we were here for holidays. 100% recommend. Only 3 stars on the atmosphere because it was both times fully packed and quite noisy but that's really not their fault I guess. Anyway, you should come here for food and you won't be disappointed."
Happy London,4.0,"I had an amazing experience at Happy Restaurant in Central London. The food was absolutely delicious‚Äîevery dish was cooked to perfection with rich flavors and high-quality ingredients. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a great place to relax and enjoy a meal. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive."
Happy London,5.0,"Superb burgers - the best I've had in this country, a league above most other burgers including plenty of 'gourmet' burgers. Big, fat, juicy burgers literally dripping with flavour - exactly what we've been looking for and too often disappointed, but not here. I had the Real Deal burger - 2 black Angus burgers with a chicken fillet on top, with grilled onions and an amazing cheese sauce that a really nice smokiness to it but not OTT. I had sweet potato fries and whilst I would've liked a few more as like you got if you ordered chips, they were cooked well and nice.

Very very nice, thanks.

Staff were friendly and attentive, prices were fair."
Happy London,5.0,"I went here In January for my birthday I had such a good time! There were 7 people including myself we were able to skip the line outside as we were a big group, they put us in a booth but then moved us to somewhere bigger. The food and drinks were amazing, service was good and so was the entertainment the vibes in the restaurant was indeed happy, since it was my birthday they came out and sang happy birthday for me with sparklers and a free slice of cake I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Dont mind me writing this review months laterü§£"
Happy London,5.0,"All menus were excellent. The spaghetti was al dente. The squid and chips so crunchy. Normally, I don‚Äôt eat squid except this dish.
Atmosphere was good with nice song. Staff were friendly."
Happy London,3.0,"You are here for the vibe and atmosphere really and not so much for the food, I ordered the steak that should be medium rare and was a bit dry and overcooked.

But loved the birthday celebration that the restaurant provides to the customer, so much joy and fun."
Happy London,5.0,"Had the best experience at Happy, everything down from the customer service, starters, main perfection. Massive thank you to the lovely Vanessa who provided excellent customer service, made us feel very comfortable and had an amazing smile on her face which just made us feel immediately warmüòåüòå"
Happy London,5.0,We loved our meal at Happy üòä The venue is beautifully decorated and the staff were friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and the portions were a good size too! This is my 3rd time coming to Happy and I'll definitely be back when I'm next in London üíï
Happy London,5.0,"I had a great experience at Happy Bar & Grill! I ordered a burger which was absolutely delicious ‚Äì juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. I also had a lemonade that was super refreshing and really hit the spot.
The atmosphere in the restaurant was pleasant and welcoming, and I felt comfortable throughout my visit. The staff were attentive, friendly, and always available when I needed something. I was especially impressed by how punctual and responsive the waiters were.
The food arrived quickly, and everything was fresh and well-presented. Overall, I had a wonderful time and I‚Äôll definitely be coming back. Highly recommend!"
Happy London,2.0,"After seeing this place on Tik Tok which I usually always trust for food, we decided to give it a try. It was such a disappointment and we won‚Äôt be back. Food was mediocre, have had better quesadillas at Taco Bell for a fraction of the price. Very expensive but the staff are friendly. A large proportion of the menu wasn‚Äôt available too which was also very disappointing to see. Don‚Äôt believe the tik tok reviews. It is nothing special."
Happy London,5.0,Fun and relaxed atmosphere but the food and drinks were modern and upscale without being pretentious! A traveling foodie can jump in as they are for a delicious dining experience!
Happy London,5.0,"Always our first choice when we say we want good food. From our favourite authentic Italian carbonara to their steak and calamari, all are ‚Äòchef‚Äôs kiss‚Äô. Photos uploaded were from our last two visits last Feb and Apr 2025. You‚Äôll usually see a long queue during dinner time but they can accommodate you in just few minutes of waiting since they have a huge place."
Happy London,5.0,"Having previously enjoyed Happy Bar & Grill in Sofia, Bulgaria, I was eager to experience their London location, and it did not disappoint. Situated in the heart of Piccadilly Circus, the restaurant boasts a vibrant atmosphere that seamlessly blends lively music with engaging birthday celebrations, creating an enjoyable dining environment.

Culinary Experience:

Our meal commenced with the Fried Calamari, which was impressively tender and flavorful, earning an 8.6/10. The Cheeseburger Roll followed, offering a delightful fusion of classic burger flavors in a unique format, meriting an 8.7/10. The Beef Tacos were a highlight, featuring succulent pulled beef atop tortilla bread, complemented by cheddar, caramelized onions, chili mayo, tomato salsa, baby gem lettuce, guacamole, and ranch sauce‚Äîa harmonious blend that also deserved an 8.7/10. The meal culminated with the Beef Cuban Sandwich, a satisfying combination that achieved an 8.9/10.

The children‚Äôs menu was well-received by my kids; however, the mac and cheese had a notably rich buttery flavor, which may be overwhelming for some young palates.

Ambiance and Service:

The restaurant‚Äôs lively atmosphere is enhanced by cheerful birthday celebrations, complete with clapping and singing, adding a festive touch to the dining experience. Each table features a convenient push-bell system, ensuring attentive service without interruption.  Ôøº

Overall Impression:

Happy Bar & Grill in London successfully delivers a diverse menu and vibrant atmosphere, making it a worthwhile destination for both families and individuals seeking a memorable dining experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone looking to enjoy a delightful meal in the city."
Happy London,5.0,"I was going to eat at the hard Rock cafe but at the last minute decided to eat here instead and I'm glad I did! At first I was sat next to a family with a screaming baby, but when I asked they -happily- moved me to a different table. I ordered the Mac n cheese with meatballs and garlic toast and it was delicious! So many menu options it was hard to decide. I also had the magic lemonade which had a lovely presentation! I found the portion sizes to be just right. I wanted to try one of the desserts but was too full. I'm so glad I found this place, I might come back before I leave London to try a different dish!"
Happy London,5.0,what a great restaurant! the food was absolute top tier. the chicken tacos really stood out to me as the chicken was shredded and lots of toppings. the truffle fries though were the star of the show! great service aswell and nice and quick. didn‚Äôt have to wait long to get in and out as we were at the theatre and only had a small gap to eat dinner!
Happy London,5.0,"Love this place first time we tried it on our wedding anniversary 23rd June, initially the name put me off as we were passing as it didn‚Äôt really look like somewhere I‚Äôd want to go for a anniversary meal but how wrong I was and I‚Äôm glad we went through the doors ! There‚Äôs so many choices on the food we struggled to choose as they all looked good, from the off the staff were all very happy and welcoming and went out of their way to say hello as we walked through to our table, the toilets were even nice, the seating at the tables were very comfy arm chair like chairs and the food was quick and very good and I had travelled from East Sussex for a day out in London and would come back here again very soon !"
Happy London,5.0,"What can I say? The steak was juicy and well seasoned. I paired it with mashed potatoes and was the perfect match.
The place is clean and refined. The service is pleasant and decent."
Happy London,5.0,"Amazing food, tasty drinks, nice atmosphere, nice music and smily service.üôÇme and my girlfriend loved it. Is out top restaurant so far. Thank you guys for welcoming us here. 100% we will come back to try different items from your menuüòá"
Happy London,3.0,"Overall experience was great, the staff performing, dancing and singing was amazing. It took us by surprise but added to the already fun and cheerful atmosphere.  The food on the other hand was quite average. Not bad, but I wouldn't go specifically to look for something good to eat. They have plenty of different options to pick from but the quality of the food is not spectacular. Although the cocktails were pretty decent. Typical price for London at an average of ¬£10 per cocktail. I would say it's a good place to go with a group of people for the experience itself."
Happy London,4.0,The food was perfectly cooked and the environment was very beautiful. The service was good the food came relatively quickly and they made sure everything was good. Lots of birthdays so the staff had to kept going round singing which was interesting.
Happy London,5.0,"Amazing place, it's big and the most important, despite the open kitchen, you won't leave smelling of food. Highly recommended. Very well located next to Piccadilly station."
Happy London,4.0,"Had a great time, food was tasty and the vibe was chill. Big shoutout to Mihaela and Ofeliya for the awesome service. Super friendly and made sure everything went smoothly. Would definitely come back"
Happy London,5.0,"Fun place to visit. Good food and funny cocktails that had a great taste. They have great selection of food and you will have to come again to try the rest of menu, because it is all good üòÑüëç."
Happy London,5.0,"Genuinely just try it, and you will understand how worth it this place is. Venci provided impeccable service and was very sweet, made sure we felt welcome. The food should be on TV, for the quality it feels like we were robbing the place blind.
100% recommend, also a man dressed as Jim Carrey‚Äôs The Mask came in and was running around having fun, 5 star experience."
Happy London,3.0,"I wanted to go to this place for a very long time, because the menu looked really good and there is always a long queue. I went last night with my boyfriend and we were very excited about it.

It was a Saturday evening and the queue was a bit long, but the wait was not bad at all. It is really big inside with many tables, and the atmosphere is really nice. It is a busy place and, whilst we were there, the staff sang happy birthday at least five different times to different tables, and the whole restaurant engages with them. I can see how this can be fun for groups whilst it might bother other people. We thought it was entertaining. No complaints about the service, the staff was really nice and didn't take long to serve.

The food itself was a bit disappointing or not as good as I would have liked. We had the thin fries, which are crispy and greasy. This was probably our mistake to order, but annoying that they don't offer french fries, only the thicker fries, which were not amazing either. We had the prawns with parmegiano sauce, which were alright. Then, some chicken with guacamole and fries; the chicken was okay, the guacamole and fries just alright. We also had the steak with mac and cheese. This was probably the worst part; the mac and cheese was okay, but the steak had a very weird soft texture that you wouldn't think it was a steak, and we did not enjoy. They also served the sides with a sauce that had a smokey-weird flavour. We asked what was in there and the waiter just said it is a secret recipe. Fair enough, but I only wanted to know why I didn't like it. We thought we paid too much for the quality of the food.

The cocktails looked cool, but didn't have any, so not sure how good they are. Same for the desserts.

If I had to go back I would probably choose a burger, maybe safer option."
Happy London,5.0,We had an amazing time. With amazing food. And all of the staff that served and helped us were friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. It was a very welcoming place. The cocktails were amazing!!
Happy London,5.0,"Fun Spot in the Heart of London
Happy Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus was a pleasant surprise. The location couldn‚Äôt be better right in the middle of all the action. The vibe is lively, the staff are warm and welcoming, and the food hits the spot: big portions, tasty, and nicely presented.

It‚Äôs not fine dining, but it doesn‚Äôt pretend to be. Just a fun, casual place that delivers exactly what you‚Äôre hoping for. We did have to wait quite a while for dessert and the bill, but they were packed so fair enough. Would still go back!"
Happy London,5.0,"Happy Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus is a great spot with a varied menu, offering something for everyone. The food is delicious, especially the Mexican section‚Äîquesadillas are a must-try! The pulled beef bao buns are exceptional and not to be missed. The service is impeccable, and the staff is incredibly friendly, hospitable, and attentive. The atmosphere is lively, though it can get overcrowded and noisy at times. Still, it‚Äôs a great place for a fun and tasty dining experience!"
Happy London,5.0,The starters were literally 10/10. It‚Äôs really hard to find good foods like this. The service team was excellent. 2 girls serving us at lunch was very helpful and quick. Food came out quick aswell. Just abit disappointing with the BBQ rib size and steak was 6/10 but will definitely visit again and try new menu‚Äôs. Thank you
Happy London,5.0,"I have a new favourite restaurant in Town. I defy anyone to not enjoy the dining experience at Happy. The menu is so varied you will find something you'll like and you'll love the service and ambiance. But take care to book or get there at slightly off peak times, unless you like to queue!"
Happy London,5.0,"What a place, the food was amazing, so much choice to choose from. Nice menu lay out with every dish pictured, and watching our dishes and other tables food come out they all looked like the picture in the menu.
The flavour was fantastic and a really good size plate for the reasonable price.
Highly recommend, and can't wait to go back to London so I can try another dish."
Happy London,1.0,"Service is great, all the food we got was not great. I ordered a steak for medium, it‚Äôs not just well done, it was EXCELLENT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ (way too overcooked). spaghetti bolognaise had no flavour, just taste like cheap cheese. Overall too overpriced for the quality of the food"
Happy London,3.0,"Not a great experience  at this place. Menu is very misleading as portion size portrayed is exaggerated in the menus. Service was poor and link to allergens was not available. We tried 3 different devices and were not told or provided with an alternative format. The waitress was annoyed at us and was rude. Stake was not cooked as asked. not worth paying ¬£25.00 when you can get a sirloin for ¬£6,00 at tesco and cook it better at home. Some of the food was tasty would recommend the calamari"
Happy London,5.0,"We went there for a small family  celebration and it was perfect. The interior and atmosphere were great, beautiful and welcoming. Food was excellent although our opinions about the cheese cake with Brazilian chocolate were divided. It's the only thing none of us will order again.
The service was lovely and our waitress was nice, smiling and helpful.
There was a lot of singing Happy birthday in English and Bulgarian - depends on the clients and even dancing a famous Greek dance.
Lovely place, definitely will visit many more times."
Happy London,5.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a restaurant that truly lives up to its name, Happy is the place to be! From the moment you walk in, the energy is infectious‚Äîbright, lively, and effortlessly fun. The vibes here are unlike anywhere else in London; it‚Äôs the kind of place that puts a smile on your face before you even take a seat. The playlists? Absolutely spot-on‚Äîa perfect mix of feel-good tunes that make your dining experience even more enjoyable.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the service. The staff are some of the friendliest, most genuinely happy people I‚Äôve come across in a restaurant. Always smiling, always attentive, and making sure every guest feels special. It‚Äôs rare to find such a warm and welcoming team, and it truly makes a difference.

But the real star? The food. The selection here is one-of-a-kind‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think any other restaurant in London offers such a unique variety of dishes while maintaining such exceptional quality. Every bite is an experience, and the portions? Incredibly generous! Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for something hearty, fresh, or indulgent, there‚Äôs something for everyone‚Äîand it‚Äôs all absolutely delicious.

Happy is not just a restaurant; it‚Äôs a mood, an experience, a place that guarantees good times and great food. If you‚Äôre near Piccadilly Circus, do yourself a favor and go. You‚Äôll leave with a full stomach and an even fuller heart."
Happy London,5.0,"Very popular chain back home so we decided to try their London branch and we were not disappointed. Whilst the menu here is different, we still found many great options. My daughter didn‚Äôt quite like her first choice but we were offered a replacement without having to pay for the first dish. I found that fantastic - and very clever - because of that gesture we are now guaranteed to come back!
The staff were really nice and friendly, the interior is pretty and the place is clean. See you soon!"
Happy London,4.0,"The food is really amazing , the atmosphere is awesome, the staff is really friendly and good music, yes maybe a bit expensive but it's all worth it"
Happy London,5.0,"Had the pleasure of dining here recently Anis Barakat was an absolute fantastic host, memorable service and incredible atmosphere. Sat right between the bar and the chef station. Didn't pay service charge and Anis gave me no pressure for doing which was pleasantly refreshing. The place is called happy for a reason every single person and face was so welcoming out of the staff and I didn't see one disappointed customer. Food was literally amazing and I would, have and contine to visit this place."
Happy London,5.0,Everything was amazing! The food and drinks were so delicious and the waitress was so kind. The place is modern and nice.
Happy London,4.0,"Good food but small portions. Well presented.
Service is quick and courteous.
Weekends usually have a wait time.  Recommend that you book your table here.  The ambience is good.  (Except the toilets that are shabby and best avoided).

Usually casual atmosphere.  Definitely worth trying and you never know you may fall in love with this place depending on your state of mind."
Happy London,2.0,"I came here with my partner on 24th May 2024 and also 9th February 2025.

Although I really wanted to visit here as it seemed like a great choice to come and dine, on both my occasions I found that the food was not great at all.

On my 1st visit 24th May I had came
Here with my partner, we ordered the crispy beef alongside my main the steak and chips and also partners meal chicken tenders.

Both my meal and the sides came warm/cold which I had asked the waiter to replaced. The water had asked me if I would like it to be warmed up again which I was quite offended and said no I would like another one made fresh as the meat was cold and chips were dry as if this was reheated. My starter was not bad but again wasn‚Äôt hot when it was served. My partner‚Äôs food was ok but the mac cheese was full of grease and seemed to be recooked.

This brings me to my recent visit this week on 9th feb, I was skeptical to come back here with my partner but as there wasn‚Äôt a long queue we decided to give it another go‚Ä¶

We ordered our food with a waitress who didn‚Äôt know any of the menu which wasn‚Äôt helpful at all, I defied to go for the half chicken with chips and my partner went for a piri Piri chicken with mash potato (both dishes were simple).

On arrival I found yet again that the food wasn‚Äôt hot enough, the chips again after my last visit almost a year ago was dry and didn‚Äôt taste like a chip, my chicken had no flavour at all instead was extremely salty and almost uneatable! My partner liked her chicken but as you can see the was hardly any mash potato on her plate but instead a pool of water grease! I didn‚Äôt hold back and asked the waiter to replace my chips and my partners mash potato which he kindly did.

After we finished our meals and asked for the bill we noticed we weee charged for both replacements at ¬£4.99 each plus service charge. I asked the waiter to take this off because of the above which he didn‚Äôt seem to want to do until I had a go at him which he went and spoken to his manager.

We ended up getting the items removed but overall ¬£45 for 2 chicken meals and a small portion of fries o mash potato is not worth it.

I gave this place a second chance and they blew it! I can‚Äôt recommend this restaurant as it left us leaving ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù rather than Happy."
Happy London,3.0,"Whilst the food was very good. The service was average.. We received very sarcastic service from a female waiter when we asked where is our order and for a fresh set of cutlery. When I previously asked a male waiter for an order update he couldn't even understand English

The manager apologised afterwards but this is still not what I expect from service"
Happy London,4.0,"My friend & I visited Happy & we shared the garlic & herb dough balls, beef sliders, BBQ pork ribs, bao buns with crispy chicken, and pulled beef loaded fries. The dough balls were underwhelming, appearing only to have garlic on the top (where it is visible), so I would have been better off just getting garlic bread. However, the beef sliders were exquisite; succulent and tasty, immediately getting Happy back on my good side. The pork ribs were strangely small, but the rack itself was so comically long that it evened out and, most importantly, they were very tasty. The bao buns were also very enjoyable, but the pulled beef on the loaded fries were unimpressive - the fries themselves however were perfectly fine. Overall, a mix of pleasure and disappointment, but the positives were good enough for me to say I‚Äôd definitely visit again."
Happy London,5.0,"THE BEST RESTAURANT IN LONDON!
I went to Happy in Piccadilly Circus on my birthday (19th Feb) and had a wonderful time with my friend. Where do I start from?!
I had a booking at 6:30pm and although there was a very long queue ahead of us, me and my friend were given the opportunity to jump up the queue and get a table straight away. The hostess that greeted us and sat us down (the lovely Bulgarian girl with dark brown hair) was incredibly welcoming and friendly, and had the prettiest smile and aura.
The moment we were sat down another waitress with very long brown hair (forgot to ask about her name) came to the table and took our orders. She was very nice and had very good customer service skills. She looked very happy and made us feel very welcome and at the right place.
It took us 4-5 days ahead of our reservation to choose the meals we wanted to have as their menu is very big and has literally everything you can think of. (A little advice - check their menu online before the day of your booking.)
I ordered the Greek salad as a starter, and my friend ordered the garlic cheesy bread, as well as another type of bread (photos have been attached) and we were both very impressed by the taste and how easily they could fill us up. For our main course my friend ordered the black Angus Cuban sandwich as well as a side of mac and cheese which both left him speechless as they looked and tasted amazing. I ordered the beef skirt fillet in their signature sauce with a side of truffle mashed potatoes. Oh my god! It was so yummy!! After I ate it all, I had no space for dessert. Awesome value for money!
Drinks-wise we ordered two lemonades that we weren‚Äôt a fan of as well as the dragon daiquiri and ‚Äòthe tall one‚Äô which were quite nice. The presentation of the drinks was immaculate!
Last but not least, I wanted to mention that the atmosphere was very unique and made me feel at home as I am from Bulgaria which as we were told by the hostess -  90% of the staff actually were too. I love how their staff played some Greek music and started dancing which I‚Äôve never seen before at a restaurant and which I think is a very interesting entertainment concept.They also put a lot of effort into birthday celebrations - they play birthday music, and a bunch of their staff gathers around the table singing a song to you which I find to be very fun and memorable.
The food arrived very quickly and our waitress as well as the runner were very professional and friendly at the same time. Shout out to the hostess for making us feel welcome and taken care of.
Me and my friend will definitely come back!
10/10 ü©∑
Thank you Happy!"
Happy London,5.0,"Happy has become a staple for my fianc√© and I when we visit London! The food is always delicious, (although I wish there were some fresh vegetable options for a side dish or something other than a salad!)

The arancini is to die for though, so I fully recommend that... every single time. The service is always incredible, super friendly and entertaining. We really enjoy that it's non-intrusive, there is a 'doorbell' on your table which allows you to call the waiter when you want them!

We'll continue to eat at Happy every time we come to London, and we'll always recommend it to people who tell us they're visiting!"
Happy London,5.0,"Very delicious food and good service. I know the restaurant from Sofia (BG) and wasn‚Äôt disappointed ü•∞

Without reservation we (table for 3) just got in after 5 min of waiting. üëåüèº

PS: If there are a lot of people on their birthday, you gonna here quite often to ‚ÄûIt's My Birthday‚Äú
by will.i.am and Cody Wise üòÖ"
Happy London,4.0,"‚ÄúHappy‚Äù restaurant in Piccadilly Circus is a delightful spot for a casual dining experience, offering vibrant energy and family-friendly vibes. The food itself scores a solid 7.5/10, with tasty starters and lovely cocktails that elevate the menu.

The real highlight, however, is the atmosphere and staff, who go above and beyond to make celebrations, especially birthdays, feel extra special. It‚Äôs a lively and festive environment, perfect for group gatherings.

On the downside, it can be challenging to find a table without a reservation, especially during busy hours. If you‚Äôre planning a visit, booking ahead is highly recommended to avoid long waits.

Overall, ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù lives up to its name with a cheerful ambiance and a strong focus on celebrations. A great choice for special occasions or a fun night out!"
Happy London,1.0,"I was served raw ribs.. I took one off my sons out for my birthday meal.
no apology nothing offered. Manager was rude and couldn‚Äôt care less. No feed back from chefs until I left and asked.
Was advised by the manager ‚Äòit‚Äôs impossible for them to be undercooked‚Äô the chefs feedback.
while I understand ribs can be pink/tender this was what I call alive pink. I have become unwell and response from happy isn‚Äôt great. Just be careful and check your food."
Happy London,5.0,"We love Happy London! It was the highlight of our trip two years ago and it was just as good this time Summer 2025! I love the pasta, the picture menu, nonalcoholic drinks and the atmosphere‚ù£"
Happy London,3.0,"Honestly the atmosphere and staff were great. The cocktails are good and it didn't take long to be seated. But the food is so terribly mediocre, I was so disappointed.
We had the mac and cheese steak and nachos. The nachos just use the patty mince im sure of it and it was greasy and flavourless. The steak and mac was tasty, but for the price it devalued its flavour. We just expected more of everything for the price."
Happy London,1.0,"This place was a SCAM, one of the worst restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to!!!!! Avoid at all costs. The food was one of the worst I‚Äôve ever had. The chicken was so raw and the bbq ribs were so undercooked and with barely meat, the sauces were so poor quality, they were basically from the supermarket. Also why are the portions so small as if they were given for free ?? Each plate was 20¬£ or more !!!! We paid 50¬£ in total and we left hungry as ever. For 50¬£ you can get actual rich food somewhere else. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this place. The waiters are also so boring, no interest in serving, everything is rushy, this honestly felt like a fast food chain. The toilets were DISGUSTING too. I‚Äôm surprised this has won best restaurant in the past cause I don‚Äôt see it where. I wish I could get a refund or at least an apology cause this was a scam and a robbery. The food was way too small and poor quality for that High price. The music was way too loud and everything just felt too fast food kind of. Horrible experience and I‚Äôm never wasting my money in a place like this ever again. Look at that menu and then look at the actual food. A SPAM ! I‚Äôm so angry cause we all work hard for our money so wasting in places like this is disgusting."
Happy London,5.0,"Great food, great vibes and very friendly staff! Just make sure to make a reservation if you don't want to queue outside"
Happy London,3.0,Very well located restaurant for tourists. The menu is extensive and typical American diner style. The portion sizes are smaller than expected and are very greasy. They have many cocktails available but most were coloured with food colouring. Average price came to ¬£40/person. Service was quick and dining environment is average.
Happy London,5.0,"One of my favourite restaurants, they have a phlothera of dishes from every cuisine. I always get the shrimp dishes. Pretty reasonable For central London. The entertainment is pretty interesting too üéâ"
Happy London,5.0,"Where to start amazing price
Amazing variety of food
Great quality food
Great variety of drinks
Great price, atmosphere is beautiful fun vibrant
Service is astonishing I have nothing but praise please do not miss out so definitely worth it!."
Happy London,4.0,A very nice experience. Food came fast and was mostly tasty. Portion sizes are on the tad small side. Cocktails all tasted good! Deserts were just okay. Would have been nice to get the same waiter through our meal. Had four that I can remember
Happy London,4.0,Enjoyed the food and drinks very theatrical hair in the creme brulee but they did remove it from the bill recommend the truffle cauliflower the mac and cheese is awful it tasted artificial i have to say service was friendly everyone greeted us everyone said goodbye
Happy London,1.0,"Happy's food comes with a sadness. Located in the heart of Leicester and Picadilly Curcus, the restaurant attracts a large number of foreigners and nationals. There was no need for booking, and we have been seated in literally less than 3 minutes from the door to the table. The team was always attentive, friendly, and efficient. They took every order correctly, and the food was served accordingly. I ordered a Kiwi ü•ù  Vodka and my companion a Pinaple fizzy drink. Unfortunately, the 11 (counted) ice cubes leave me with nothing but less than 30ml of cocktail, which is nothing but pricey. The soft drink wasn't any better. The salad was acceptable, but to my surprise, there was a huge difference between the illustration in the menu and the food served to the table, to which the staff commented ""this is only for marketing"" and I found it very inappropriate. I turned back the plate, and I refused to accept the dish. None of the dishes was presentable enough, nothing more far from reality. I also made use of the restroom, and I lost any appetite thereinafter. A nife that was drpped off the table remained on the floor during the entire time, and the attention to detail was completely absent at this place. The restaurant is in very unpleasant and dirty conditions. Overrated, overpriced, and debatable food presentation. First and last time."
Happy London,5.0,"The restaurant has a good variation of food, they have seafood, steaks, chicken, tacos and salads. Everything looks amazing. I had the pasta with shrimp, perfect presentation and flavour. My wife had a salad and it was amazing too. The service was very good.

I fully recommend this place!"
Happy London,5.0,"We booked a table for two for our wedding anniversary meal following a great review from our son.
The service was very good in general and the food was great, albeit slightly different from the photos on the menu in appearance.
We noticed some birthday celebrations around the restaurant which was a nice touch from the staff (nothing for wedding anniversaries though!).
When it came to requesting the bill, it was displayed on an electronic device and it wasn‚Äôt clear (until we‚Äôd paid it and looked through the printed receipt) that there was an ‚Äòoptional‚Äô service charge of ¬£15.96 added (12.5%). By this point, we‚Äôd already given the waitress ¬£10 as a tip, which she gladly accepted; so it turned out that we‚Äôd paid nearly ¬£26 in gratuities.
I feel this ‚Äòoptional‚Äô charge should be highlighted on the electronic device when the bill is presented."
Happy London,4.0,"Almost every 30min they‚Äôre celebrating birthday,The restaurant includes Service charge.Steak was delicious,but the sizes are little bit small.Beers around 6-7¬£,Steaks 22¬£.Garlic Bread 3.50¬£ (3pcs).The location is good."
Happy London,5.0,"Wow, what a surprising gem!
I had such low expectations when we came in, because it looks like a typical tourist trap. However, the food is delicious, the prices are very reasonable, the variety of dishes is amazing, and the service is great.

I highly recommend the French fries with the truffle. It is d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. But seems like everything else is great too.

I had the chicken steak with the signature sauce - would come back just for that.

Can't wait to visit again!"
Happy London,5.0,"Happy is a Great place with various options to get food if you are in central London. They have amazing service and quick seating. Food prices are average for central London and the food portion sizes are fair.
I will be returning here sometime again in the future."
Happy London,5.0,"I had never heard of this place and stumbled across it with the wife. We were both very impressed, the food was lovely and the selection, incredible. She had mexican and I had chinese. They cater for all tastes you can sit down with friends and you will all find something you want to eat. Totally recommended."
Happy London,5.0,"Food is great. Price is reasonable. Great wait staff and convenient location!

What's not to love about the place. Happened to stumble upon it and decided to grab a quick meal. Was thoroughly surprised with how good it was.

Definitely a recommend for me if you are in the area."
Happy London,5.0,"""Happy"" restaurant in Piccadilly Circus is a delightful spot we where in London celebrating our 50th birthdays  with family  members and it definitely lives up to its reputation it was a very pleasant experience food  definitely scored 10/10 it was delicious very tasty and starters were lovely and also had a few cocktails that were gorgeous  anyone visiting I‚Äôd definitely recommend booking a table in advance and definitely recommend HAPPY for celebrations and a great night out"
Happy London,5.0,"I great place for a pure touristy quick lunch or dinner. Everything appears to be catered to Americans (except for the portions). We Americans are use to larger plates and portions. But there are plenty of deep fried favorites coupled with fries. Can‚Äôt go wrong with that combination. It‚Äôs OK to want for home base comfort foods occasionally while on travel. We liked it when we wanted something quick.

The prices are really good, considering you are in the heart of the tourist area. But be mindful that the portion is a bit smaller.

The staff are amazing!! They all were extremely kind, hey, and professional."
Happy London,5.0,"Had the most wonderful food here today, absolutely delicious.Highly recommend"

Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at Govinda‚Äôs in Soho, and I must say, it‚Äôs a truly delightful experience! The food is wonderfully fresh, flavorful, and nourishing ‚Äî a perfect blend of vegan and vegetarian options that cater beautifully to every palate.

Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Flavorful Vegan Indian Food!
I had a great experience at Govinda Vegan in London. The food was absolutely delicious ‚Äì packed with rich spices and bold, flavorful seasoning. Every dish felt comforting and satisfying.

The staff were very kind and welcoming, which made the meal even more enjoyable. I also love that the menu rotates ‚Äì it keeps things interesting and gives you a reason to come back. I‚Äôm definitely planning to return soon to try more! A must-visit spot for anyone who enjoys authentic Indian vegan cuisine."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Visited today for lunch. Hardik served us. Great guy. The Lady helped with arrangements. Lovely staff overall. Great food. Surely come back whenever we will be in London.
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Wonderful food, great selection of lunch/dinner options, drinks, and desserts - everything was fantastic and great value! The atmosphere was nice too, and it was no surprise that the queue was long (worth the wait) and tables all full. The staff were all so friendly and helpful too :)"
Govinda's Soho Street,3.0,"I tried the ¬£7.95 Veggie Thali at Govinda‚Äôs London, and overall it was a mixed experience. The food itself was quite average ‚Äî while the portion was fair, the flavors didn‚Äôt really stand out. The service also wasn‚Äôt the best. The server seemed impatient which affected the overall experience.That said, the place itself has a nice, homely vibe, and it feels welcoming if you‚Äôre looking for a simple vegetarian meal at a reasonable price."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I've visited Govinda's Restaurant two weeks ago, and I've enjoyed in great food and ambience, that not only filled my stomach, but also my soul.

Greetings from Croatia! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"First time eating at Govinda and was definitely not disappointed. The food was fresh and tasty. Great selection. We got the large platter as we wanted to try a selection of the food on offer. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.
Really relaxed atmosphere. I will return for sure!!!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"A Nourishing Experience at Govinda‚Äôs

Just shared a beautiful meal with an old friend at Govinda‚Äôs in London, and I‚Äôm still glowing from the experience. This vegetarian gem which caters for vegans with ease has such a warm, spiritual feel - it‚Äôs more than just food, it‚Äôs soul nourishment. The cuisine was absolutely fantastic: fresh, flavourful, and prepared with love. The staff were genuinely friendly and welcoming, adding to the sense of being cared for. A perfect blend of taste, atmosphere, and heart. Highly recommend for anyone craving more than just a meal."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"One of the last remaining gems of old soho! This place has soul and community, not just because of its spiritual roots, but because of its community engagement, accessible food prices and even free food! It‚Äôs so heart warming it‚Äôs survived so long and the people that work here are great!

Food is always delicious, hearty and filling, especially for the price! It can get very busy so during the week I recommend around 7pm to come and eat.

Thank you!"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"Food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Has a very Mom and Pop kinda feel to it. Not a ton of seating, but if you get lucky you can grab an outside table."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Delicious vegetarian food and lovely atmosphere! I returned several times during my recent stay in London and found the variety of options, portions and prices most agreeable. Highly recommend!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"All the food we ordered was delicious and really cheap, can‚Äôt recommend it enough! That being said keep in mind that this place is really popular and gets crowded so you will probably need to wait for some time to get food. Also it was really hot inside so we had to get everything as a takeaway."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,this was a super yummy thali!! very decently priced - i got the veggie & my friend got the deluxe which got good reviews. the berry lassi is amazing and also vegan so was very happy with this!! there is a big queue but people move fast and the staff were v friendly. would def return :))
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The most delicious vegan and pure vegetarian food available here, mist visit if you want to enjoy such food and also the atmosphere is great. There are lots of other Indian snacks also available at a reasonable price. We also tried srikhand which is a dessert and it was delicious as well, I would have liked it more if the quantity was a bit more but overall it was a nice experience. Checkout the prices in the videos and the food as well. Hare Krishna üôèüèª"
Govinda's Soho Street,3.0,"Went to this place as read some good reviews and watched some videos on YouTube and must say was disappointed
The place was busy as we went for the lunch time so  expected it to be busy
The service was really bad and I was disappointed by this, I know it was busy the person on the till wanted me to make a donation and I was not too keen
I had the deluxe thali and the puri had all the oil from the fryer and when I asked can I have a different one she was not too keen
The veg samosa tasted nice
The curry with thali was a con, they were overloaded with veg and sag aloo had broccoli and cauliflower making it rubbish but it is also makes it look big
So very disappointing to experience and there is a lot of pressure to buy stuff or donate and I don‚Äôt like that
As a vegetarian the place did smell like I was in India but it didn‚Äôt taste as good
If you do go, go for the basic thali as that is worth the money if you go for anything then go for the first one of the thali which costs 7.99 and is most possibly the best option

So a no from me, like the temple and the ambience but the food is not just that good and the service can be better"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Excellent authentic food served by great people, Sujith, Krish and china aunty served best service. Must recommend to all devotees and great place for family. Hare Krishna"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Awesome food with best service in London. Got a really temple vibe. Very friendly and helpful staff too. Much recommended
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"We had a wonderful family lunch at Govinda‚Äôs in Soho, and it exceeded our expectations on every front. The food was wholesome, flavorful, and served with the kind of freshness that makes you want to come back often. The ambience strikes the perfect balance between warmth and simplicity, making it a welcoming space for both families and individuals.

What really stands out is the value for money,
considering its prime location in the heart of London, Govinda‚Äôs is refreshingly affordable without compromising on quality. The staff were courteous and attentive, which added to the overall experience.

A hidden gem in central London for anyone looking for delicious vegetarian fare in a relaxed and family-friendly setting. Highly recommended!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I‚Äôve been eating at Govindas for many years. The food is delicious wholesome and very well priced for central London. Despite being Hare Krishna infused, you find people from all walks of life eating there. It is a welcoming satvic environment üôÇ"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"nice lunch experience, full of straightforward well seasoned and heartwarming flavors:]    though the bread felt a bit stale and bland:[
there‚Äôs a lot of queue so come early!"
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"Authentic indian food, really tasty a little bit spicy. But with the mango lassi the heat is really easy to handle.

I had the veggie plate and really good vegetarian diverse food options."
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"Govinda's restaurant was a lifesaver for my Shravan Monday fast while I was traveling. It‚Äôs a great option for people with dietary restrictions, especially those who prefer Satvik food, as they offer meals without onion or garlic.

They have four types of thali to choose from, along with drinks like mango lassi and various desserts. However, I wouldn't recommend the mango lassi, as it didn‚Äôt taste very good."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Really delicious food in a lovely friendly setting. The staff are all so kind, and the service is exceptional. It is such good value for money and a refuse in the busyness of Central London. I recommend adding a kachori to your order (yummy pea filled ball!)."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE Govinda‚Äôs! I‚Äôve been coming for years and it‚Äôs always delicious. As a vegetarian, it‚Äôs great to have found a place that does pure veg and isn‚Äôt expensive. There are 5 thalis to choose from and they‚Äôre all delicious. The one in my pic is the large thali. Would give it a 10/10. You can also get lasagne, spinach pie, and veggie burgers, but the thali is always my go-to."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Visiting London from the US. My mother is Vegan so we wanted to come to a place that she didn't have to limit herself with the menu. All four of us thoroughly enjoyed the food. Staff was kind and the atmosphere is great. This place deserves a bigger dining space the food is excellent but the seating area is very crowded. If you are Vegan, Vegetarian or anything else, you should check this place out."
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,"The restaurant is clean and the service was prompt. The restaurant is small, which a great sign that the business is doing well. Hopefully, they need a bigger restaurant because of all of the business! The food was amazing! I have been a vegetarian for many years and it was nice going to a restaurant with only vegetarian options. I loved that! I would recommend this place to anyone."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Enjoyed my food here ,  it's in the best area , surrounded by shopping places and it's busy area."
Govinda's Soho Street,4.0,Nice small restaurant with vegan and vegetarian Indian food served like buffet style really tasty better to sit outside hot inside
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Great food options and excellent service although sitting can be tight at times and expect a queue normally.
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"My one goal on my trip to London was to eat some good Indian food, and I was amazingly satisfied after eating at Govinda's. All I can say is, if you're Indian, this is the place to go. Everything tastes home-cooked; the ambience reminded me exactly of the casual Indian places I'd go growing up in Singapore. The one tip I'll give is that you don't have to get a set plate ‚Äî I didn't realize until after ordering that I could have just ordered √† la carte (I wanted some samosas, and they weren't included in the thali I got). Don't skip the mango lassi. My stomach and heart were full after this meal!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,A great vegetarian restaurant in oxford street specially for indian customers. I love the place sacred as well as serving the best homely simple food. Have been here 5-6 times and everytime i am more happy leaving ! Sujit thanks to you as well for the polite service.
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Had a wonderful time here. The Temple and the restaurant are full of kind, genuine people, which adds to the quality of the experience. Lovely authentic Indian, I'm quite fussy but it was great and as a vegan I was very pleased with the options. Incredibly cheap, especially so for London, spread in picture was ¬£10 and it shows it's ran by passionate and generous people. üíì"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The food was affordable and absolutely delicious! The desserts were incredibly moist and bursting with flavor. Highly recommend this spot‚ÄîI‚Äôll definitely be coming back!
Went back the next day and my meal was still delicious."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Coming to Govinda‚Äôs is always a great experience . Pure food with no onion garlic and the temple vibes around it adds to the charm . Also it‚Äôs great value for money . I went with my parents , hence ordered 1 extravaganza thali and one large thali  and we shared it amongst the three of us. I only had to order extra chapatis as it comes with only 1 chapati per thali and there is a poori in the extravaganza thali. But there is plenty of rice too in each . Both Thalis were delicious. There is only a difference of 1-2 items in each thali as you go up on the price . When I go alone I order the basic thali with is around 8.95¬£ and the quantity is enough for one person.
Govindas closes at 9 and the temple closes at 9:30. So be mindful of the time if you go late in the evening."

Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Wonderful and authentic. I tried masala dosa and parantha with daal. Just perfect for foodies or desi folks missing ghar ka khana
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Tasty vegan and vegetatian Indian food, if you love Thali this is the place with varied dishes like dhal, rice, paneer, subji, vegan and vegetarian burgers, savoury pies cakes with a variety of sweets like gulabjamun. They also have many flavours of lasi drink. The place is busy but service is fast, so it is worth the visit if you are around Soho."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The food was delicious, very well seasoned and the atmospheres  was so vibrant and cosy at the same time!! The prices ohh my , VERY affordable üòÅDefinitely  a place to recommend and to come back ! It was hard to believe findind this gem, so close to Oxford Street"

Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Wonderful - great food, price and atmosphere! Will definitely come here again"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Just a wonderful place! The food is great, the staff are friendly, the patrons are accommodating (which is great as you share tables) and if that weren't enough, there has been prayers said over the food. Must visit for veggies (and vegans as there is vegan options)"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"You know it is good when your mum says it is EXCELLENT!

We‚Äôve dined here many times over the years. Lasagna is layered superbly with many vegetables and the tomato sauce is seriously good.

The thaali‚Äôs are great value for money and never disappoint.

Today the restaurants offered Ekadashi friendly food which went down a treat. We ended up ordering take away too!

Wholesome, fresh, flavourful!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"It's hard to find vegetarian indian food and this place serves just the best Indian vegetarian food I had in London. It's next to Iscon so you get to worship before you can enjoy the meal

The service is quick and the staff are friendly"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Food is great awesome loved it & best one for vegetarian staff helpfull & good.
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Good meal for a good price. I got the paneer meal. It was a good amount of food for dinner and it was tasty. Tasted like home cooking.  Very nice that it's all vegetarian.
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Very good value food, easy to get to. Busy and bit cramped for space but otherwise good environment."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Quality food and amazing hospitality. The line waiting line was long, but it‚Äôs worth the wait."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Lovely friendly atmosphere. The food was delicious and truly amazing. We had The Govinda's which we 2 adults shared. Couldn't possibly have eaten by myself! Highly recommend and excellent value for money.
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Best Indian food we had in London. It was blessing in disguise considering we we could hey satvik food without onion and garlic in Navratri while away from India ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The quality of food ,the taste -(full of taste & with love & smile) ,the cost -( so reasonable - no cheap for london prices) .Just gastronomical treat of delight ,will not disappoint you -anyone,I personally give a challenge to eat this quality of pure vegetarian food anywhere in London.
Order the deluxe +higher quantities thali, but make sure you're seriously hungry- it harder  to finish than it looks.
Enjoy - savour, you don't even have to be a hindu or a full blown vegetarian .
It's that good .
All run by volunteers, treat them with respect ,they dedicate their time out of love & devotion.
Be Happy"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"The food was absolutely delicious! If you are short on time and want something flavorful, this place is perfect! I had ‚Äúthe large‚Äù."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"WoW
For sure we are going back there!!
Lentil soup was delicious!! Lasagna,
Curry, Beans, Spring rolls.... MMMMM!!
Staff was very friendly!
The only little thing that we missed maybe, was some information about the choice of the food, cause it all smells nice, and we didn't know what to choose ü´£
Thank You all"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Amazing Indian food! I ordered a paneer, an extra chapati and a mango juice all for ¬£12. Worth every cent, the creamy chilli was delicious, a bit spicy and very well made. The mango juice was really good too. Tap water available at all times, with a good ambiance! Definitely recommend, I ate loads for a very good price"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Very aromatic food. The portion was enough for two people. Personally, I can't stand fresh coriander, and there was plenty of it, it's worth remembering"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Very tasty and authentic cooking at very affordable prices. Indoor seating, outdoor and takeaway.
The food is delivered as a thali, a big plate with different dishes.
Everything is vegan or vegetarian, which is great.
Outdoor seating is nice, pleasant views but little direct sunshine.
We noticed strong cleaning product smells when it opened up, which is good in itself, but felt is was an indication of imperfect ventilation. I didn't feel the HVAC unit was working. So we ate outside."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic, loved the food and service!! Very authentic, and such a lovely atmosphere in central soho"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Decent amount of vegan options. Very tasty and affordable. It is very busy, but they will get you through the line quickly and help facilitate getting a table. We had a vegan cake as well that was tasty but a little dense but super cool they had the option!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Wonderful experience eating here, beautiful food and happy staff. A fantastic experience. Recommend everyone to go!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"If you want to eat/drink something authentic and delicious, this is the one. It really hit the spot. Also, shout out to the auntie serving the food, she is super fast !!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Jai Jagannatha

Unbelievable experience. This was my first visit to London and never expected such a divine atmosphere in London. The moment you step in to restaurant, the aroma of prasad instantly reminded me of food prepared in temples in Odisha.

The peace of mind this place while having food is unparalleled. Food quality is best for a vegetarian. cannot expect better elsewhere in Europe. Would love to visit here everytime to have darshan of Shri Jagannath and have prasad."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I absolutely adore this restaurantüíöThank you so much for your kindness, delicious healthy food and peacefuk atmosphere. It's my second time here in three days and I'll certainlu be coming back soon. Thanks!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Amazing place with real values ‚Äì total respect!

The food was absolutely fantastic ‚Äì fresh, authentic, fully vegetarian, and made with care. You can tell this place stands for more than just food ‚Äì it‚Äôs about culture and conviction.

Some people apparently think it‚Äôs funny to walk in with fried chicken just to provoke. All they really do is embarrass themselves. That kind of disrespect doesn‚Äôt make you cool ‚Äì it just makes you look like a global joke. Good on the staff for standing their ground.

Keep going strong, Govinda‚Äôs ‚Äì don‚Äôt let clowns like that ruin the vibe."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"I love this place and try and visit whenever I‚Äôm in London. It hasn‚Äôt changed much in the 13 years I‚Äôve been coming, but that‚Äôs partly what makes it wonderful. Great value, tasty, healthy food and brilliant for vegans. Staff always so welcoming and the atmosphere is lovely. An authentic little slice of India in Soho! There is the request for a donation when paying by card, but that fits with the ethos and social values of Govinda‚Äôs and I‚Äôm happy to contribute."
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Most amazing meal in London. I always come back, and this restaurant delivers the best meals over and over ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Very good vegetarian food with excellent service and really affordable prices. Will come again, thank you!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Food was great, very tasty, waiters attentive, staff behind counter seem a little disconnected when serving but overall a good experience. It can be a little chaotic if you are seated along the row of tables where people queue for food as people tend to hit you with their bags as they move towards the serving station. If you want somewhere more private/intimate  I would suggest a table outside"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"Super busy but the quickest service ever! It‚Äôs a saviour in soho- a rare find where you can eat like a king for under a tenner! Good for vegans, good the wallet! how do you make food so tasty without onions and garlic?! make new friends sitting next to strangers- food brings us together!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,Namaste üôèüèº Amazing! For the first time on the west i felt like in India. 100% authentic taste and style. Thank you so much. ‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ ‚Ä¶
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"An absolute gem! This Hare Krishna restaurant is a haven of pure, sattvic dining.

The food is simply divine‚Äîfresh, flavorful, and prepared with devotion. Every dish bursts with authentic, balanced flavors, making it a truly nourishing experience. The thali was a standout, offering a perfect blend of textures and tastes, and the desserts were an absolute delight!

The service was impeccable‚Äîkind, attentive, and always with a smile. The staff truly embody the spirit of hospitality, making the experience even more special.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a wholesome, soulful meal infused with love and tradition. Can't wait to visit again!"
Govinda's Soho Street,5.0,"A real hidden gem off Oxford Street. Authentic Indian cuisine that was refreshing and tasty with just the right amount of heat.

Excellent value for money in Central London. Will be sure to pay it another visit.

Went for the Deluxe which had a wide variety of items. Highly recommended."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,,Óóä
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Outstanding sharing plates and creative flavour combinations! Clever and thoughtful approaches to classic dishes. My friend and I shared 2 small plates and 2 large plates. We thought the ceviche and the cauliflower were particularly stand-out dishes with creative textures and spices. I also really loved the feta + apricot starter, it was such a fun, fresh dish. Their house-made sodas were fantastic and perfect on a hot London afternoon, highly recommend the mango & coconut soda.

Underrated spot, will definitely be back!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Second visit to Bala Baya and it was as delicious as the first. The small plates are delicious, and manage to be both light and filling . The hummus breakfast was a favourite among my group, with creamy hummus, chick peas, and warm pita.

The mini mess aubergine dish had great flavour, especially from the sweet onions. Cocktails were well made, and our server was friendly and attentive, keeping a fresh water bottle on our table throughout and bringing a small extra on the house.

I strongly recommend this for anyone who likes mezzo food."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Exceptionally good!
The place is really nice too, a lot of space between tables.

Not cheap, though: we spent ~94/person (~3 tapas/each +  pita, a bottle of wine, dessert and coffee or dessert drink)"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Had a great evening here with friends. We ordered hummus, pita, nuts, bagel, cabbage, cauliflower, prawns, chicken, fish ceviche, as well as two desserts.

The small and medium dishes were all great. The desserts weren‚Äôt really to our taste.

It was a bit noisy and hot upstairs so we asked to be moved outside. Beware it if rains. Staff were all friendly and ready to look after you."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Best Mediterranean food I‚Äôve had in a very long time, if ever. We arrived at 3:00pm, an awkward in between time for kitchens and the host kindly allowed us to sneak in an order even though the kitchen was near closing.

The quality of the food and cocktails were impeccable. We ordered the basil and mint sour, the aubergine mess, the hummus with short rib, and the lamb kebab. Beautiful flavours and it will be a definite return trip and recommendation to friends and family in London."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"It was amazing. Lost for words. A whole flavour party took place! Would 10/10 recommend coming here, experiencing the layers of flavours was breathtaking and the service and atmosphere had matched it perfectly :) we ordered quite a few and amongst them all, would recommend, chickpea hummus (it comes with 2 pitas), aubergine mess, wagyu, prawn baklava. If I‚Äôm honest, I would love to come back to try other dishes!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"This is an interesting restaurant in Southwark. It is Israeli, but serves mediteranneen food. The set up and interior decor are very unique, with a cozy terrasse along a small lane. The food is ok. Aubergine mess was a tasty dish, as well as the Brisket Doughnut. But the price is a bit high, for medium sized portions."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Go here if you like Middle Eastern food. Really good food and a great vibe. We went for the vegan tasting menu at ¬£45pp. Plenty of variety, lots of food and everything was very tasty. Loved the bagel stick, cauliflower and skewers but in truth everything was amazing and full of flavour. We were served a vegetarian option with goats cheese by accident but I spotted it before consuming it. The vegan dessert was not for us but grateful they had given some consideration to it beyond fruit.  I‚Äôd highly recommend this restaurant to vegans and vegetarians.  There are not many places that cater for mixed groups of people with differing dietary requirements to this extent. This was beyond the usual Lebanese / Middle Eastern fare with broader influences from North Africa.  It is on the pricey side but worth it. ¬£160 for 2 people for the vegan set menu, olives and a bottle of white wine.   The service was excellent. The waiter took his time to answer all our questions and didn‚Äôt rush our leisurely vegan feast. He also packed the leftovers avoiding food waste."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Came here for lunch with a coworker.

We got the chickpea hummus with pita ü´ì. It was very tasty. Would add a little lemon to zest it up perfect as is.

My coworker got the cauliflower steak crumble, which he loved. Packs a punch in a small dish.

I had the Laffa Couture (grilled chicken) dish which was lovely. I would eat it again. If I could add extra pomegranate juice onto the dish...I would."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"I came to Bala Baya with the London Cuisine Club and we had a pleasant experience. We sat outside under the awning and enjoyed the lively, welcoming atmosphere. The service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive, cleared plates promptly, and brought out new dishes as they were ready. It is very much a sharing-style restaurant. The food was well-prepared and enjoyable."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Delicious food, innovative arrangement of familiar middle eastern ingredients. Service was helpful- not pushy, but if they had one of my cousin‚Äôs chocolate baklava cakes for dessert we would have ordered it!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Food was good, tasted fresh and definitely recommend the Lamb Shakshuka.

The construction next door was unbearable noise and it was on a Saturday afternoon so unsure why that was."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Incredible food and service. Highly recommend the prawn ceviche and aubergine. Very quick service and friendly staff. Highly recommend.
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"The food here is very creative, colorful, and delicious.  It‚Äôs amazing how they combine all the flavors to make them so good.  Bread is baked in house.  Excellent service.  Really great experience."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant food - a taste sensation. Lots of natural light and green plants create a fresh atmosphere. Cocktails were well made,  not too syrupy or diluted.

Blown away with the food. As a vegetarian I was truly spoilt with choices.
What we thought would be a simple carrot side was a spectacular layered and textured dish, colourful carrots cooked to perfection with crispy tofu and a lush sauce. Hot potato was cordion layered potatoes in a rich but not heavy sauce.

Black forest is my favourite and dessert didn't disappoint. Light chocolate sponge drizzled in chocolate and deep cherry sauce.

Service matched the quality of food. Cannot wait to return and try other dishes and brunch menu."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"The most delicious food, prawns & homemade flatbread & everything aubergine are incredible! Fun complimentary shots for celebrations, delicious cocktails, beautiful restaurant interiors & outdoor seating, friendly service at just the right level of attentiveness"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"We dined at Bala Baya as a group of four and tried a variety of dishes. My favorites were the aubergine mess, brisket doughnuts, and hummus so good that we ordered the latter two twice! The hot potato was tasty but small, the cauliflower steak was as good as cauliflower can be, and the kebab dumplings had a bit too much cumin for our liking. Service was excellent despite a delay in getting our table, the staff was so kind and helpful.
Overall the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Me and my mum came here whilst staying nearby for the weekend and I'm so glad we did.
Despite some of the London drink prices, we thoroughly enjoyed the food. We ordered the hot potato, dumplings, beef donut & hummus. We both agreed we would absolutely re order the hot potato, hummus and the donut, my mum really liked the dumplings too. The beef donut was the star of the meal for us as well as the hummus - it was delicious.
Unfortunately, I felt that the flavour of the dumplings was a little overwhelming and sickly but by that point we had decided the beef donut was the best by far so was hard to top. I would definitely come here again and feel that both the hummus and beef donut would be a future must order, aswell as the hot potato (even though the portion size was a little small). we were recommended to have 2 dishes each which turned out to be more than enough!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Genuinely, this restaurant is off the charts AMAZING! Everything perfect and delicious. Thank you so much to our lovely waitress Ines, she really enhanced our night. We went with all of her food and wine recommendations, she nailed it :)"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"An Israeli gem near Southwark, perfect for sharing plates packed with flavour - great for meat lovers, vegetarians, and dip enthusiasts!

Here‚Äôs what we tried:

‚≠êÔ∏è Kebab Dumplings: Hearty and meaty, these dumplings hit the spot - so satisfying.

‚≠êÔ∏è Prawn Baklava: The highlight of the night! Sweet, savoury, and totally unique. It‚Äôs a bit on the pricier side, but worth trying at least once.

‚≠êÔ∏è Aubergine Mess: An incredible dip for pita, with the perfect balance of smoky aubergine and a hint of sweetness from lychee.

‚≠êÔ∏è Roasted Butternut Squash Hummus: Rich, creamy, and full of flavour - a must-order.

This is definitely a spot to visit as a group to try a variety of dishes. There‚Äôs something for everyone, especially having vegetarian friends. üôå"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Wonderful dinner at Bala Baya! Not only was the place beautifully decorated and modern, the food was insane! I‚Äôm a big mediterranean food fan and this was definitely on my top 3 of London! Definitely on the pricier side, but would recommend for a date night!

We got their hummus topped with meat, and aubergine dip! Both were sensational!
We also got their chicken and roasted cauliflower! Everything was a 10/10! Perfect pairings and interesting flavors."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Decent spot for brunch - the mini mess was yummy, and the hummus, the feta, the pita and the tomato and chilli dip were fine. The burnt babka was okay, we were expecting it to have more flavour (though it‚Äôs baked well). Servers were friendly though service was a bit slow and they seemed to be needing reminders. It is a bit pricy as we didn‚Äôt have any mains and still paid ¬£40+. All in all, it was a decent experience but nothing stand-out for me personally and thus, expensive for what it was."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Food was delicious, especially the sauces. Many vegan options clearly labeled. Service was a bit slow, the dishes would take quite a long time to arrive. But worth it and it‚Äôs great to be able to pay with Yums from TheFork!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Really impressed by the food and its a good vibe! Make sure you order aubergine mess and the ceviche!
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Food was utterly incredible. The Beef Carpaccio was one of the nicest dishes I have ever had. One of the best dinning experiences in London fully recommended.
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,The best dishes were the prawn and the Jerusalem bagel. De - shelled fried prawn wrapped in a little bit sweet baklawa noodle. Best to eat the bagel hot.
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Firstly, wow!

Secondly, Love is a great waiter. Polite, enthusiastic and helpful - he made our night even more special:)"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Love the food and experience! Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Will be back!
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Was staying nearby and dinner plans fell through; found this place and what a dream, some of the best food I‚Äôve ever eaten. Gorgeous setting both in an out, fabulous service and food that I will think about for a long time"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,1.0,"Bad vibes. Claimed it was Israeli food but in fact Jordanian, Palestinian and Lebanese. Also had ‚ÄòMoroccan‚Äô doughnuts‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs Israeli about that. Staff were rude

Edit in response: I‚Äôve added pictures to prove I was there. The food wasn‚Äôt too bad in all honesty but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone to go here if you actually want a positive / enjoyable experience without paying a fortune on inauthentic food. Staff are extremely rude and unfriendly. Shows in managers response to me!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Absolutely the best dinner I‚Äôve had in London thus far.  The kebabs were incredible and our waitress was unbelievably attentive and helpful.  I‚Äôll be visiting here each trip!
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Absolutely delightful experience from an amazing menu full of things I‚Äôve never seen before‚Ä¶ ‚Äòsmoked watermelon‚Äô to plates of delicious food e.g. Moroccan Brisket donut and Cauliflower Steak it was all excellent and also Tzika was a great waiter
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"A very initimate food experienceüòç it is very pricey and food portions are really small but it is worth an experience. The aubergine mess is out of the world!! We ended up ordering twice! Totally recommend that. Some vegetarian options!

The place is good but might be difficult to find it per google maps. It is in a small lane tucked quietly."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,The Flavours was really good despite both my Prawn and Cauliflower dishes yogurt sauces looks similar but completely different. I like the complex and complimentary flavours for the Prawns.  Only the prawn head was bit darker indicates freshness but thank god they taste amazing.  I order the Mix  Salad but came the cauliflower but no regards üòãüòãüòã
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"I stumbled upon this restaurant by chance (it was a saved pin on my Google Maps) and it turned out to be the best culinary discovery of my last trip to London. I was by myself and I didn't have a reservation but was greeted by an extremely helpful hostess and seated right away.

The service was genuinely fantastic. While the pace was more relaxed than what I'm used to back in the States, it offered a truly enjoyable and unhurried meal. And the food... it was absolutely incredible.

I was so blown away that returned the very next day with a friend, just to share the experience. It's rare for a restaurant to leave such a lasting impression, but this one certainly did. I can't recommend it enough."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Really epic food and very cool restaurant. I'm excited to go back to try the rest of the menu!! This is one of the top mediterranean restaurants in London. Easily at the level of The Barbary but, if I may, at better prices and without the booking headache.

The staff was super friendly and knew their stuff. They recommended the majority of the dishes and they did not miss. Our favourites were the aubergine mess, the kebab dumplings and the short-rib hummus."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,3.0,"3.5/4 - came as a high recommendation from a friend but overall disappointing for price : quality ratio. Nice courteous service and lovely location, pretty gorgeous. Split 4 dishes for lunch and was a good portion for two.

üëçüèª The aubergine mess was the best dish and had nice nuance to the flavours albeit sitting in a puddle of oil.

üëéüèª the baklava prawns were small and close to ¬£30. Not a strong baklava taste, thought it would be more of a take on prawn toast, but are just grilled and battered prawns with some pistachio and sweetness (honey potentially). Quite disappointing given each prawn was ¬£10 for a few morsels. The quality is not quite up to pay to expect fine dining prices for me.

üëéüèª The kebab dumplings were dry and hard, meat was not flavorful at all. Not juicy at all, clumpy even. 3 parcels for ¬£23, and less flavourful than an Asian takeout place. Kind of tastes like nothing.

The cauliflower was alright, tasted very same-y with the same labneh drowning every dish we ordered, which thankfully added a bit of moisture to the kebab dumplings.

A la carte menu pricing is quite strange overall, brunch looks like it could be more promising but I'm not inclined to prioritize this restaurant again."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Outstanding food and service. Tzika (sorry if I got the spelling wrong), who looked after us was brilliant and claimed that their Chickpea Hummus was the best in London. Now I am not a Hummus connoisseur, it was out of this world!
We booked this restaurant for our anniversary dinner and it lived up to the expectations.
Highly recommended!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Perfect meal - staff incredible, food sublime. Interior was gorgeous & so clean. Can‚Äôt wait to go again. Vegan sharing menu was excellent!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Had no idea what to expect from Israeli cuisine but to my surprise it was excellent. The menu is short and simple, and the food I cannot recommend enough.
The star of the night for us was the eggplant mess,
But the other dishes were equally amazing.
Since we were 6 of us we got to try a lot of things from the menu.
The cauliflower was great, the beet salad , the kebab dumplings, the prawns , the hummus and the pita breads they were soooo good, light and fluffy.
Would definitely recommend to try"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Amazing restaurant. Excellent quality food and great atmosphere. Squeezed us in last minute and staff were superb. 100% would come again
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Had no idea about this place but came across the website and thought it looked fantastic. We tried a number of dishes, we did the set menu for two, twice. So had the full experience. I was blown away by everything. Couldn't recommend highly enough. Wine was also unreal."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Amazing food - the best Middle Eastern food I‚Äôve ever had
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"We had an absolutely fantastic early dinner here.
Aman our waiter was lovely and gave great recommendations on the menu and was generally gave us the right level of attention for our date night dinner.
We drank great cocktails and sat outside under the heaters.
The food is phenomenal we didn't go wrong with anything on the menu, the beef houmous was beautiful, slow cooked beef with a bowl of houmous and some flatbreads. Honestly I think I could have just ordered that five times over and sat there all night. But we also ordered half the rest of the menu. They did a set menu which in hindsight we probably should have gone for and taken home what we didn't eat as we both woke up the next day trying to figure out an excuse to come back!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Quite an inconvenient location to visit as they are hide inside an alley. And its quiet for a sunday night
Restaurant which do israli cuisine. love the sevice there, i didnt look for the menu and i just asked our waiter to recommend a few dishes to us. All of them are so nice. And the plate are presented nicely. Price is also reasonable

Would visit again."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,The staff is absolutely lovely. The food was so delicious and the brunch feast feels like great value for money. We have two non alcoholic homemade infusions which were tasty and refreshing. Can't wait to come back again!
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,Tzvika made our Graduation Dinner evening meal very special for us; very kind and friendly explaining the menu options etc. The sharing plates were outstanding; very tasty and great new flavour combinations for us. Great vegetarian options. Really excellent evening. Thank you team - from the welcoming lady on the door - to the kitchen - you guys are amazing ü§© üôèüèª
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"The most delicious food I‚Äôve ever tasted!!! Beats Spanish, Italian, Japanese and even Turkish (my experience)! Absolute must try!!! Service is amazing! Everyone goes the extra mile to make sure you‚Äôre acknowledged and your needs are met! The best part is that is pet friendly- I bow to this!!! Well done Bala Baya!!!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Must Try restaurant..
I had Aubergine Mess, Chicken Cotoure, Lamb Dumpling, Hummous. And most important there Pita bread.  I absolutely loved the taste. Going there again soon."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"The restaurant boasts an impressive array of vegan options. From what we sampled, the majority of dishes were rich in flavour and quite delightful. Particularly outstanding were the bread, cauliflower, aubergine, hummus, and Jerusalem artichokes ‚Äì each bursting with its own unique and savoury profile. However, the experience was slightly marred by the vegan dessert, which unfortunately had an off-putting texture and an odd taste that didn't quite hit the mark."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,3.0,"The waitress was nice and tried to find out about gluten-free items on the menu for me.

However, the food was salty and heavily seasoned and it was so overpowering. The hummus tastes like our tahini with salt so it actually tasted bitter.

The lamb dish was really spicy and heavy too.

People were smoking outside, but there is a  canopy that keeps the cigarette smell between tables. We even got cigarette ashes into our drink.

Overall, it is not a place that we will return."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"This is a lovely little restaurant tucked away near the station, lovely atmosphere and lovely stuff, and the food is super tasty! Totally recommended, we'll be back."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Delicious food, great atmosphere (inside and out), and super friendly staff. Hummus was really smooth (slightly too salty but really tasty), the aubergine dish melted in your mouth. The three of us did the tasting menu for ¬£68, it was a great selection but we were slightly disappointed when only two small desserts came out for the three of us to split, there were plenty of dishes for the main course but this seemed a little stingy considering we were paying +¬£200 on food. I‚Äôll definitely be back but won‚Äôt do the tasting menu as I didn‚Äôt think the value was worth it."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,Absolutely loved all the savoury dishes on the set menu however we tried all 3 desserts  available and I found them all incredibly unenjoyable which is so bizarre as I‚Äôve pretty much never met a dessert I didn‚Äôt like. It was disappointing as the menu was bursting with flavour and even the vegetarian dishes really impressed so I was definitely expecting more from dessert
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Very excellent Israeli food served sharing platter style, in a wonderfully lovely place with excellent ambiance.

Our only complaint is our extra serving of pita took so long to arrive we'd almost finished the food, although we got an extra set of bread and it was so yummy, which made up for it.

Cocktails were also excellent, try the champagne martini.

Would heartily recommend!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"We were looking for a place to eat close to our hotel and what a find this was! Food was amazing from start to finish.  Tasty, plentiful and looking really good. Service from the very friendly team was great, wine lovely and as I said before.....food was amazing! We will be back!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Great experience and great food at Bala Baya with the Prawn Baklava and Aubergine Mess the stand outs! It's my 4th time here üòÖ

Good place to go with a group so you get to order a variety of dishes and try them all! We got 13 dishes among 6 people and that was more than enough.

The cocktails were also quite unique."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Came here for a Sunday brunch with a friend and the weather was perfect for an outdoor meal.

Waiter was very attentive and friendly to me while I waited for my friend to come. We went with the labaneh and za'atar and tahini dips with pita as starters. Then I ordered the brisket doughnut and my friend had the hummus breakfast. The tahini was so nicely done - nutty, smooth and rich, went so well with the pita. Za'atar was something I hadn't tried many times before so I wasn't the biggest fan but it was nice to try something new. My brisket doughnut was amazing, the beef brisket was tender together with the tahini and the orange spiced jus was like a party in my mouth, bursting with so many different flavours which all went so well together. I thoroughly enjoyed my food! The hummus breakfast that my friend had on the other hand though, was slightly salty so that's a mini minus point there, although that's just our personal preferences. I also ordered a cappuccino on the side which was rather average, just wasn't the kind of texture or strength I normally prefer.

The vibes were really chill and relaxing and all staff were smiley and approachable. Interior design is modern and minimalist which is nice. I would be really keen to come back here again soon!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"The restaurant is hidden in an alley, great ambience, staff are very friendly although a bit slow. Great for conversations. Food portions are small and pricey. We ordered six  plates between four of us but not enough for everyone. I liked most of the dishes. The hummus is creamy and well seasoned. The grilled sea bass is really nicely grilled! My favourite was the prawn baklava, very clever and tasty dish but I forgot to take a photo of it. Would still recommend but wish portions are larger!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Fantastic experience! The restaurant gives off cool modern vibes and we loved the ambiance as soon as we walked through the door. We also enjoyed the music in the background. As for the food, the marriage of flavours was truly extraordinary. Everything was excellent, we absolutely loved every single dish all the way down to the smallest detail. The staff was very approachable and friendly. We definitely recommend!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Great tasty food, lots of vegetarian options. Very attentive and friendly service. I had lunch with friends and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you so much üôè"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Generally a nice play and great outdoor seating. I had the vegan options (about 5) and they were all good, my least favorite was the mushrooms and the best being the cauliflower steak.
Good choice of drinks and cocktails but found the service slow and unattentive.
Food also arrived at different times which I don't mind but wasn't forewarned.
Prices are moderately high and I'm not yet convinced I would come back for more.
Great place to meet friends and have a good social time. Plenty of seating inside on 2 levels and I liked the gender neutral facilities."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,I would give them a TEN rating if that were possible. The waiter was extremely kind and helpful with recommending food options that would cater to my allergy. I had the eggplant and cabbage vegetarian dishes and both were extraordinary. The portions are meant to share but since I was traveling alone I actually ate both plates of food myself and do not regret one bite.  I have never had eggplant and cabbage taste so incredible with such a mysterious array of flavors and textures I felt slightly awkward at the table humming with happiness at  each and every bite. The wine he suggested was excellent as well as the coconut cream dessert.  If you are in London staying near the Bankside area I encourage to check out this special restaurant and chef.
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Been here now twice is 4 days! It's that good. Went once for dinner, once for lunch, and ordered the same three dishes.

The hummus is fantastic, and the salsa that comes with it, is incredible and was a touch spicy.

The cauliflower steak was again incredible, so we'll presented - full of so much flavour. Genuinely tasty food.

The star of the show and really a must order was the aubergine mess, the plate looks like a piece of art, and just tastes delightful.

Having ordered the same 3 dishes twice, for two people, it was slightly disappointing to be given 3 piece of pitta bread to accompany the dishes the first time we went, and just 2 pieces the second time. It would be nice to have some consistency there. Also, if I had to criticise anything about the meal it would be the quality of the pitta bread - for a place which produced such magical food, I'm sure they can absolutely nail their pitta bread. Which sadly they didn't. However this does not detract from how good the food is here - if you are looking for flavour packed food that's well presented, you must go here.

The ambiance during the evening on the mezzanine floor is also really lovely, definitely enjoyed it alot more than the outside seating during the day."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,1.0,"Very poor vegan food, just tasted burned. Not being able to do any vegan potato option is ridiculous. Avoid unless you like grilled meat.

The owner came back and said they did spiced potatoes, they 100% did not when I went. Also half the menu vegan is a joke. They offered me 4 vegan options on the entire menu. I had a cauliflower steak that was just charred to a solid burn on the outside. The aubergine looked like it was punched into a mash. All the dishes I was offered just came with humus, humus is great but 3 dishes with it and over cooked vegetables for ¬£70 was incredibly disappointing."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"The food was amazing, have been before and it‚Äôs still good."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"I‚Äôm a sucker for playful, tasty small-ish plates and Bala Baya delivers! The menu is quite interesting, and surprisingly heavy on vegetarian dishes. We started with light snacks, but the bigger sharing plates were the showstoppers. The pink carpaccio was probably the single best dish, with the baklava prawns being a close second. Among the meat dishes, kebab dumplings were delectable. The brisket doughnut was the only thing we tried that wasn‚Äôt particularly memorable. They also have a small but respectable selection of mostly Israeli themed cocktails and wines. TBH, my only complaint about the food is that some of the plates were a bit small for the prices.

The space itself is quite cool, nestled under a railway arch and with cool industrial chic interiors. We sat on the upper floor, which unlike many other places had respectable space between the tables."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Great tasting food although portions were small. The tasting menu at ¬£60 per person seemed excessively expensive but we couldn‚Äôt gauge how much food that was, also we all would have had to have it.
In the end we just decided to all chose 3 dishes each, which we shared, this was sufficient but not filling.
Unlikely to back, but great atmosphere and friendly staff."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Delicious food with interesting mix of flavours and stunning presentation. Fantastic , friendly service . A hidden gem."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,4.0,"Very nice restaurant, great Mediterranean tastes - quite unique portions and combinations of flavours, I loved it

The price is a bit on the high side, certainly higher compared to my expectations

I‚Äôm certainly planning on coming back to try some of the others portions"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,3.0,"We visited Bala Baya for the second time last night. The food was very good overall ‚Äì full of interesting and unusual flavours that we hadn‚Äôt tried before. It‚Äôs not quite outstanding, but we enjoyed the dishes and the creativity behind them.

Unfortunately, the service let the experience down. When we asked questions about the menu, the responses felt abrupt and almost rude. We had booked with a special offer, which was ignored when the bill came, and we were charged full price without any explanation. It was also hard to get a waiter‚Äôs attention to order drinks, and when the food arrived, the person delivering it didn‚Äôt explain what anything was ‚Äì they just placed the plates down and walked off. We felt a bit like an afterthought throughout the evening, which really dampened the experience.

To top it off, at the end of the set menu, we were given just two small desserts to share between four people, which felt unnecessarily stingy. When we mentioned it, they reluctantly offered a third dessert ""on the house"", which took ages to arrive and ended up being dry and overcooked.

We really wanted to enjoy it, but sadly the service made us feel like a bit of a bother, and that took away from what could have been a great night."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Amazing food and service. We had the sharing tasting menu for 2, and honestly it was so much food. 3 large plates of food to be eaten with dips, a cauliflower roast and a whole sea bass later, absolutely stuffed. Deliciously stuffed."

Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"The prawn baklava was amazing. The flavours and texture was unreal. However that would be the only thing I'd go back for, as the other dishes were not as stellar (also had aubergine mess, lamb kebab dumplings, roasted cauliflower). Service and atmosphere was good though, so I've gave it 5 stars. It was very expensive though for what you get"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"This food is excellent for lovers of bold but accurate taste.
You feel a conversation on your pallet, like the words of a song meeting the melody.
I really loved it.
Sorry about the pictures, the food was so delicious I forgot to click."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Wonderful Israeli food, we ordered over ten dishes and they were all fabulous! Don‚Äôt miss the short rib hummus, lamb dumplings, and the ceviche. Really flavorful and great vibe too!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"Lovely little gem in Southwark! Amazing food, aubergine mess was amazing!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"If you've never tried Israeli food before or want to try different ingredients and flavour combinations then I would highly recommend Bala Baya. Their tapas style dishes are fresh, clever and taste great, making you want to try and more from the menu, a really good menu selection to try in a group. Some dishes you may think are heavy on the citrus or another flavour, but remember this is Israeli style food and their keeping it as authentic as possible.

Highlight dishes were the hummus with slow cooked beef brisket, lamb dumplings, tempura monkfish and the aubergine mess. Prices are what you would expect for that area in London and the quality of the cooking, so not cheap but it won't break the bank if you come in a group. If you're just ordering food, the prices are pretty decent, it will be the drinks that will rack up the bill.

The staff were really chilled and friendly and service was great and made sure we had everything we needed (even though we were a walk-in group on a Friday night!). Dishes come as and when they're ready, but we weren't really waiting too long between dishes except for the 'canoed seabass' dish which I expect takes a bit longer to prepare and cook."
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"This place was absolutely amazing üòç the food was the best middle eastern food I've tasted in London. Be warned it's on the pricey side - we paid over ¬£50 a head for three tapas dishes each and a drink. But it's so worth it! The flavours are unbelievable, like nothing else in London. Eating on the street is also a lovely touch - you're not on a main road so no traffic, the street overlooks some other buildings. So you're tucked away, but feel like you're abroad. Most places in England don't have outdoor seating, so I always love finding a place in the summer in London that does!"
Bala Baya Restaurant Bankside,5.0,"I Loved this place! The atmosphere is really lively, with a unique style and decor. The food is great, service good. We had a tasting menu for four people and it was quite abundant, however we got take aways for the food we didn't manage to finish! But every single dish was superb!! Glad to have been there, can't wait to be back!!"
